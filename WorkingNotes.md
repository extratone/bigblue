[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and "dependency hell."

"[Transitions in Journalism—Toward a Semantic-Oriented Technological Framework](https://doi.org/10.3390/journalmedia1010001)" | *Journalism and Media*

> The key problem of today’s web is located in the following paradox: while numerous technological developments enabled and promoted the production and circulation of web content, the developments required to organize, manage, and manipulate this content have been left behind.
> “the semantic web is an extension of the current web, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation”.
> In the SW framework, every piece of information will transmit its meaning

- [ ] Proprietary social media platforms have become fat and extremely wasteful.
