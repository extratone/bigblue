# Notes: Non-Commercial, Open Source, and Federated Social Platforms as Effective Community Alternatives 

- [ ] RSS feed readers were arguably the netizens' favorite means of consuming news, yet they have been systematically neglected
- [ ] Facebook as Whitepages
- [ ] Literally everybody thinks Facebook needs to be more transparent in actually substantial ways: fucking Open Source the platform dude!
- [ ] Facebook's extensive legal history.
- [ ] "Decentralization" as a term and its association with Libertarianism. 

# Terminology

"Big Data"

"Social network sites" (SNS) (The acronym, specifically.) Encountered in [this abstract of this paper](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2012/177/).



### Semantic Web (SW)

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and "dependency hell."

"[Transitions in Journalism—Toward a Semantic-Oriented Technological Framework](https://doi.org/10.3390/journalmedia1010001)" | *Journalism and Media*

> 1. The key problem of today’s web is located in the following paradox: while numerous technological developments enabled and promoted the production and circulation of web content, the developments required to organize, manage, and manipulate this content have been left behind.
>
> 2. “the semantic web is an extension of the current web, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation”.
>    In the SW framework, every piece of information will transmit its meaning

## As Public Utilities

## UX

- [ ] Facebook is not designed to be easy to use.
- [ ] Facebook's Creator Studio (for its clients) is significantly less confusing than its main interface for users.
- [ ] Proprietary social media platforms have become fat and extremely wasteful.

# Publishing

- [ ] "[The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley reengineered journalism](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/platform-press-how-silicon-valley-reengineered-journalism.php)" | *Columbia Journalism Review*

  > 1. Facebook and Google are by far and away the most important external referral sites for news traffic. According to publishing industry monitors Parse.ly, by the end of 2016 Facebook was responsible for 45 percent of referral traffic to publisher sites, and Google 31 percent. 
  >
  > 2. In 2009 Facebook launched a plug-in option to host comments from websites on its platform, alleviating news organizations’ need to tangle with the expensive and difficult business of moderating comments.
