> While there are no clear numbers yet for how many people are using such sites, there are probably at least 7.5 million people who use these Web-based social networks. That's big enough that Google has recently created its social networking site, [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/), and America Online just launched its site, [ICQ Universe](http://universe.icq.com/universe/welcome/1,,,00.html).

> Now sites such as [Ryze](http://www.ryze.com/), [Spoke Software](http://www.spoke.com/), [Always On Network](http://www.alwayson-network.com/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) are the latest to try to benefit from connecting people, this time to get a job, meet a business partner, find venture funding or simply to gather information. Of all of these, LinkedIn is the most strict about keeping its site solely for professional, business purposes.

# Origin

### Generation One ISPs

- CompuServe - [PERSONAL COMPUTERS; The Compuserve Edge: Delicate Data Balance - The New York Times](https://www.notion.so/PERSONAL-COMPUTERS-The-Compuserve-Edge-Delicate-Data-Balance-The-New-York-Times-a3b51e31b0a642688da5c0253c12d20a)
- Prodigy
- America Online

### Collegiate Networks

- As BBS/forums were built atop email, Twitter was built atop SMS.

# UX

- Facebook is not designed to be easy to use.
- Facebook's Creator Studio (for its clients) is significantly less confusing than its main interface for users.
- Proprietary social media platforms have become fat and extremely wasteful.
