# Mastodon Vs. Twitter Innovation

## Character Count

Mastodon's platform allows instance admins to customize post length, up to 5000 characters. The most popular instances including mastodon.social have a post limit of 500 characters. (Since launch in 2016.)

Twitter announces it's going to "try out" a doubled character limit (280) just *one month* after Mastodon's Big Week (when it was circulated around popular tech media.)
