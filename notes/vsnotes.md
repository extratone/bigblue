# David Blue vs. Big Blue Notes

facebook-user-experience

## Social

I've spent the past month and a half working on this just for you, so you'd better at least pretend to read it. 10,000+ words of screaming, bitching, speculation, and subterfuge, but here's the most important bit:

"One does not necessarily have to BELIEVE in the ideologies of software alternatives to benefit significantly from them. You don't have to be an activist to see that Mastodon is gorgeous, powerful, innovative, and full of hilarious, intelligent, wonderful people. You don't have to care about reforming privacy, intellectual property, or any of the other issues an alternative addresses - you need only to want a better and/or different experience."

now, I'm finally going to rest in the knowledge that I will NEVER have to write about Facebook again...

fight me.

  > I asked him about Ello, an upstart for-pay social network built on the premise that it doesn’t show you ads and doesn’t harvest your personal information. When a social network does those things, Ello’s manifesto argues, “You’re the product that’s being bought and sold.” Zuckerberg’s take was, as usual, practical: whatever ethical merits it might have, the business model won’t scale. “Our mission is to connect every person in the world. You don’t do that by having a service people pay for.” I suggest that Facebook’s users are paying, just with their attention and their personal information instead of with cash. A publicist changes the subject.

  > It’s easy to forget, 15 years, 2 billion users, and an ethnic-cleansing controversy or two later, that Facebook was a place for this kind of purposeless sociality before it was a place for repeatedly blocking and reporting your step-cousin. More than that, it was a piece of essential social infrastructure — a new layer of life that efficiently, and aggressively, reorganized social existence, describing and enabling friendships, cliques, parties, and even memories, formalized as they would eventually be by Facebook photo albums uploaded on hungover Sunday afternoons.
  >
  > Freed from the pressure to stand out from thousands of other posts, conversations on group chats tend to be comfortably subdued — even appealingly boring — in a way that Facebook status updates or tweets never can be.

And so boycotts are effectively asking people to quit Facebook with no other real alternative, which is akin to asking people to stop using electricity to combat climate change: It substitutes regression for a solution.

  >  Facebook's redesign isn't some wild swing for hyper growth. Instead, it's meant for the people who still enjoy loading up the website every day or who don't have a mobile device capable of using the company's apps. It's recognition that the legacy portal -- the one that started Facebook's colossal empire -- deserves more than the bare minimum.

Like Life360, you can can also access a dashboard of a group’s users and see where they are located in the world and whether they’re at home or work based on group-designated locations... There are some clean parallels to other consumer apps, but the biggest competitor to Cocoon is what goes down in the small groups you have in iMessage or any of your other chat apps. Cocoon wants to be a properly-interfaced social network inside a group chat where everything is for the group’s benefit only.
