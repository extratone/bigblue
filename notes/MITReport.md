# Notes on "Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization" (The MIT Digital Currency Initiative Report)

It's currently November 28, 2020, and it wasn't until an hour ago or so that I discovered an academic report on the very subject this essay is on, entitled "[Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization](https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb)," from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, which cites many sources I had already discovered, independently. I just want to make this clear so that nobody assumes I have plagiarized.

# Annotation

## The WIRED Article

> First, these tools will face challenges acquiring users and gaining the attention of developers. Tools like [Diaspora](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/facebook-open-alternative/) and [FreedomBox](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/freedombox/) encountered difficulties attracting a permanent user base, and it’s likely new platforms will, too. Social networks, in particular, are difficult to bootstrap due to network effects—we join them because our friends are there, not for ideological reasons like decentralization. **And while existing social networks have perfected their interfaces based on feedback from millions of users, new social networks are often challenging for new users to navigate.**

The last sentence, especially, is just entirely inaccurate, especially in 2020. I have yet to finish the report, or to come across discussion of UX design beyond the Eugen Tweetdeck anecdote, but insinuating that Big Social platforms have "perfected their interfaces based on feedback from millions of users" is absolute bullshit. If Facebook.com took user feedback into account, it would look very different. If Twitter took user feedback into account... Well, that's an issue of much heated debate. 

> These platforms also pose new security threats. Decentralized networks generally allow anyone to join and don’t link accounts to real-world identities like phone numbers. These systems often use public key cryptography to ensure account security. But managing public keys is hard for most users, and building software that is both cryptographically secure and easy to use is difficult.

I'm not sure/I don't recall where they were on security in 2017, but I can tell you that Mastodon and Diaspora in 2020 are very much up-to-date in terms of user account security. Two-Factor Authentication is built into Tootsuite as is the easily-accessible ability to see a recent history of login sessions per IP/device. Diaspora offers something similar to the latter, but not 2FA... Idk. I just haven't heard any mention, personally, of account security issues with these platforms, nor can I see any difference in "usability" of the signup process for them from Big Social SNS. Well... Other than positive ones.

> The reality is that most people do not want to run their own web servers or social network nodes. They want to engage with the web through friendlier platforms, and these platforms will be constrained by the same forces that drive consolidation today.

I realize that much of the insular discourse surrounding decentralized social surrounds hosting one's own node or instance, but the practical reality for a Mastodon user in 2020 does not necessitate this concept at all. 

> A better strategy would be to pursue policies that strengthen the environment for decentralized platforms, including data portability, interoperability, and alternatives to advertising-based funding models.

This is what follows the previous quote, and I ultimately agree wholeheartedly with it. I just don't understand why the article was titled so negatively, but I realize that it was *WIRED* editors that made that decision, not Barabas.
