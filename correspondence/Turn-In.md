# Turn-In

Professor Barner,

I apologize for how late my research paper is at this point. Since this email is long-winded, let me say from the onset that the first file attached is what I have at this moment as a final draft in MLA format, which I would be grateful if you would accept this late, marked down for lateness at your discretion, of course. If you are uninterested and/or too busy to bother with the explanation as follows, I understand completely.

As I was gathering sources for my essay, I began to grow excited about the concept of going a few steps beyond the assignment and attempting to write my first academic article perhaps worthy of submission to a peer-reviewed journal, largely because I couldn't find very much on my subject. I suppose I thought it was worth missing the submission date to grind out a more aspirational final draft over Thanksgiving break.
