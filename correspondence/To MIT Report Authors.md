**Subject**: A Followup Query Regarding "Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization"

Hello esteemed scholars!

I'm reaching out to you because I am in the process of writing an academic essay arguing for Federated Social Networks as alternatives to the proprietary big boys (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and have *just now* come across your report from 2017 for the MIT Digital Currency Initiative after some six months of research. I was wondering if you'd done any subsequent work within the subject in the time since/if you'd be willing to share any thoughts you may have on the state of federated social today.

Since I'm emailing you out of the cold, I'll spare you further detail until/unless you have the time to continue.

Thanks for your time!
