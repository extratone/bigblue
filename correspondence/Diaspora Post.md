Hello again, Diaspora!

I know it seems like I only come back here when I have some vaguely self-promotional shit to share. Apologies for that... Given what I'm about to share with you, this time, I really should make a disciplined effort to come back here more.

I've gone back to school for the first time in seven years this Fall and it's been an interesting ride. For the Big Project assignment in my Composition II class, I thought I might attempt at writing an academicized version of The Big Facebook Essay (which I spent most of the summer on, but never finished.) Somewhere along the journey, I also got the idea that I should maybe take the opportunity to attempt my first academic worthy of submission to an academic journal. Considering that I am already past the due date, currently, I don't think what I'm going to end up turning in is going to be my final draft.

It's taken me a long time, largely because I've let myself get distracted by more or less parallel intrigues, like the practice of [using Git for peer-review and revision-tracking](https://grasshoppermouse.github.io/2019/07/12/should-scientific-publishing-move-to-github-and-friends/). Since I'd been experimenting with GitHub recently, I thought I might as well use this project as an experiment in doing so.

All of that said... if you want to follow along in the process, here are the links you need:

* [The GitHub repository](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue).
* A [new channel on *Extratone*'s Discord server](https://discord.gg/K8bg95jRvW) just for writing stuff.
* The [main index page](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Research-Paper-4e71ec99e6bd45bcb53713c0a3bdc7fa) of my Notion notes for this essay
* The link to my [live working draft](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EcnB_3AfhsZHmGj0GYgT65cBAfKKCTbViZNpuh8aykciDA?e=cbYpkN) in Word

If you explore the repo, you'll note that I have done my best so far to include all related media - including the draft of this very post. I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts, which is the main reason I'm reaching out here.

Cheers!
