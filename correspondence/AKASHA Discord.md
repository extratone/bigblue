# AKASHA Discord

I responded to robert.akasha saying hi after I entered the AKASHA Discord.

> I'm here because I've been working on an academic essay arguing for "Non-Commercial, Open Source, and Federated Social Platforms as Effective Community Alternatives," and the Semantic Web came up along the way. I've noticed that - on GitHub at least - nobody seems to be working on IPFS-related stuff rn and haven't been for ~2 years. I'm assuming it's just moved into different development spaces under different names?

> Hi @David Blue! Well, it sure sounds like you've come to the right place. We are working on a couple of projects that fall into this space, both of which are embedded into the IPFS. The first is the AKASHA World Framework (AWF), which in essence is an open source toolkit to enable others to create decentralized social networks integrating Ethereum dapps. The second is Ethereum World, which is the first social network built on the AWF. More information will follow in early 2021, so be sure to watch this space. If we can answer any specific questions to help with your essay then please let me know.
