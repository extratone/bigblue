It'sthe conspiracy we've always suspected to be true.</b><pre>From: changw@nmt.edu (willie* chang)Subject: MS workers' confessionDate: Mon, 4 Sep 1995Posted to: comp.sys.mac.advocacyMS workers' confession:"Working in MS is so easy, just look at a Mac and monkey see monkey do,don't even need to do any R&D, and bugs are forgiven anyway..." "There're things we can't figure out how Apple does it, like how todevelop toolbox calls for apps to sum up all sorts of DTP entitiessuch as type faces and drawings, to determine the required file savingsize for the app to check disk space to fore-warn users about diskspace problem, or during copying several files the user can cancelthe operation and that the old files remain intact even when therehadn't been any additional disk/ diskette/ RAM space to retain oldfiles during writing. This algorithm is not trivial.""Other things Apple does for users' convenience like checkinginstallation diskettes (or diskette images) may already be insertedin multiple diskette drives (or images mounted) during installation,and the installation script will get on to it and not ask users forthe next diskettes if seen inserted or mounted... well, we skip thesedevelopment concerns and overheads, and just assume the user has onediskette drive, so that we don't need to do additional programming.After all, why concern the small percentage of users having multiple-diskette drive systems, right?""And about that recovering old files during files writing or copyingif the user so choose to cancel the operation, forget it 'coz usersshould make up their minds first! They should read some books, learnfrom video tapes, take some classes about how to use a computer..." "Oh and about people complaining Word saving files onto diskette tooslow, they should use hard disk, why diskette? Not a normal thing todo, just a small percentage of people would do that in a smallpercentage of occassions. Who cares?""We can dress it up like a Mac, and sell a billion bucks even if itdoesn't work. Most people would pay for it so long as it's MS product.It's futile to complain about bad products anyway since there're farmore people who don't know computer and software are not synonymousto clone PC and MS... So like I said, just put out something like atrash can uh... recycle bin and show it 100 times a week on TV ads,not only the stocks get jacked up but also Time magazine will be sayingthat we're making computer history.""A simple GUI's trick is: when something cannot run fast enough like aMac, just let additional, often unnecessary, message dialogs show up andthe user is distracted and will feel faster. AKA MS Theory of Relativity." "In order to run MS products, P5, 16M RAM, 1G disk are minimum systemrequirement, so you see MS products are very high-end, that's thedifference from a Mac Plus with M68000 (say i8088-equivalent) CPU, 1M RAMand 20M disk, which does about the same things. So MS promotes hardwareand also computer furniture industry, kinda like housing industrypromoting many other related industries, and does escalate the globaleconomy... I'm very proud of being a MS worker." willie*  changw@nmt.edu  <a href="index.htm">http://nmt.edu/~changw</a>Lawyers thrive on mishaps; religions, calamities.Heaven is no need to deal with "alfonsos" (professional as*h*les).</pre><img src="stuff/soup.sep.gif"><pre></pre><!-- new: Coping with adult-onset arachnophobia. --><p><b>There are lots of things that suck about being an adult. Dadisn't around to kill things for you, to name one.  When arachnophobiastrikes, it just comes down to who's less of a baby: your roommate oryourself.</b><pre>From: Patsyann Jones <pjones@halcyon.com>Subject: The Beast In The BathroomTo: Gen-x@world.std.comI am reposting this because I know a lot of people missed it, and,frankly, this was one of the defining moments of my adulthood. PlusPatsyann just tells a damn good story. :)FORWARD (story by Patsyann)I was just awakened, about ten minutes ago, by the sound of Michellestanding next to the bathroom going "Oh, god. Oh, god." In fact, Imanaged to incorporate that into a dream where somebody got shot andthe woman who was responsible was going "Oh, god. Oh, god, I shot him.Oh, god, it's all my fault" while someody else -- the shootingvictim's brother, in fact -- was manfully taking charge of thesituation, telling her it was only a scratch, calling the paramedics,etc, etc.They say dreams only happen in a split second, which must be true,because it seemed to go on forever, when suddenly harsh pounding cameat my door.  My first startled thought was the KGB had finally comefor me, but I have a more overactive imagination than most (notbetter, necessarily, but it does seem to feel the need to throw up themost illogical solution to the simplest of problems). But itwasn't. It was Michelle, screaming "Oh, my God! You have to help me!Get up and COME HELP ME!"I jerked awake, heart pounding, the tasted of last night's beer foulin my throat. The scent of danger seemed to permeate the very air.So I get up, and went out. I knew it had to be something serious,because nobody, and I mean nobody, ever wants to look at me that soonafter my awakening if there's the slightest chance of avoiding it. Shewas standing in front of the bathroom door, holding a broom andshaking, looking as pale as milk. "You have to be my backup. Look inthe sink."  So I looked in the sink....And there it was. The most hideous beast ever created by a vengefulGod and released on earth to do His bidding. A spider roughly the sizeof the bottom of a Coca-cola can. And UGLY?! Man, does Carmen Mirandawear fruit?  It was one of those low slung babies, with the big thickcrooked legs and a triangular body suspended between them. And onemore thing. Something so obvious it was hard to see, something sohideous.... "That spider has nine legs," I said, shocked. "It's somekind of genetic aberration," Michelle said.Michelle continued to babble from behind me, as I stood, locked insteely- eyed confrontation with the beast. "I got up. I peed. Istretched. And then I went to wash my hands...." There was an edge ofhysteria in her voice that I didn't like. I knew she was about tocrack. And if she did, I would be left to defend the household againstthe creature alone. We had one chance, my partner and I. Either stopthe beast here and now, or ....well, frankly the thought of runningaway and finding a new place to live crossed my mind.Michelle finished her report on the initial skirmish with thebeast. "So I grabbed this broom. I'm thinking I whack it with thebroom, drive it toward the drain, and then we pour boiling water onit.I shook my head. "Too risky. It could escape out the side. No, we needsomething definitive.""How about poison?" Michelle asked. "Too slow," I replied. "And notnecessarily effective."No, I decided, this situation called for the big guns. I straightenedmy hat, flicked the butt of my cigarette off into the bushes (well,mentally) and returned to my room for the ultimate weapon whileMichelle remained on guard. "What are you doing?" she asked, that noteof panic rising again.  "I'm getting a shoe," I told her. "A shoe thatI never intend to wear again."Shoe in hand, I returned to the bathroom and stepped inside to dobattle with the beast."Careful," Michelle whispered. "If it moves, I'm coming after it withthe broom." Now that action was being taken, her voice was calmer.I clutched the shoe in my hand, reflexively tapping the palm of myleft, considering. The beast was crouched on the upper right handslope of the basin. Tricky. That meant I would have to swing onestrong underhand blow, and I had a clear swing at it, but it alsomeant I only had one chance. It had to be that single blow or neverusing the bathroom again. For a moment, that seemed a viableoption. Then, I thought again. If I couldn't use that bathroom, thatmeant I would just have to learn to live with the taste of lastnight's beer in my mouth. The beast was between me and my toothbrush!No, I decided, it's the beast or me. Steeling myself, I raised theshoe over my head.I took a deep breath and lowered the shoe. Panic surged in mytorso. "What's the matter? Why didn't you kill it?" Michellesnapped. "It just occurred to me that maybe we could get Stephanie orSarah to kill it," I replied. "No, they're even worse then we are,"she said. "It's us or no one." Shamed by her courage, I gripped myshoe tighter, and raised it again.My arm trembled as I held the shoe at the most outside arc. One shot,my mind babbled. One shot. What if I miss? a darker part of my mindwhimpered. I lowered the shoe again."What is it now?" Michelle snapped. "Maybe we could suck it up withthe vacuum cleaner," I said, grasping for any straw. "No," Michellesaid. "It's not strong enough, and anyway I don't want to think aboutthat spider scuttling around in the vacuum cleaner bag." My mindrecoiled from that idea.Sweat breaking out on my brow, I turned back to the beast. I raisedthe shoe again. And as I considered my enemy, it seemed to tauntme. You'll never be rid of me, it seemed to say. You'll run away fromthe bathroom, and when you come back I'll be gone. At least, that'swhat you'll think. But in the back of your mind, you'll know I'm stillout here. And one day, when you least expect it, you'll reach for thetoilet paper, or open a dresser drawer, or throw back the covers ofyour bed...And there I'll be, like grim death on a Pogo stick. AndI'll GET YOU.I was defeated. I knew it. There was no way I could kill this beast. Iwould simply have to admit my cowardice and see if I could get a malefriend in here to dispose of the monster. Still holding the shoe, Iturned to tell this to Michelle.And there she stood, like an angel of light in baggy sweats and hairlike a crow's nest, brandishing her broom. What in the world was Ithinking, I wondered suddenly? Michelle and I were the best spiderkilling team in the world! Together, we had faced down a thousand ofthe repellant horrors.  There was our confrontation with The SpiderThat Stood On The Wall While We Were Watching TV, and The Spider ThatShut The Bedroom Door Behind Itself In Our Old Apartment, The SpiderThat Dropped Into My Hair At Bumbershoot, and of course, thatlegendary monster, The Spider That Crawled In From The StorageShed. With victories like those behind us, no spider standing in thesink could defeat us!One last time pays for all, I prayed, and raising the shoe, I struck!I seemed to hear a fading arachnid scream in my mind as shoe metspider with a resounding splat. Then all I could hear was Michelle'syell of triumph as I shot past her and dove into my room. "You did it!You did it! You're so great!" Michelle applauded me.No, I thought, WE did it, and I pulled the covers around myself andcowered.  We have triumphed again. I didn't say that, though. Thecameraderie of the spider battleground doesn't allow forsentiment. But somehow, in that wonderful moment, I had to letMichelle know how I felt. Like magic, the words came to me, just theright combination of praise, wit and encouragement to expresseverthing I wanted. to."I killed it. YOU clean it up," I said.The EndPatsyann"You know what I think would be a good thing to hang in the eveningsto keep mosquitos off of you and your guests?

Coming on the heals of the 3COM/Candlestickagreement, the city has agreed to roll over again and accept$5,000,000.00 over a period of 5 years to have the name shortened tocisco, CA.>According to a company spokesman, "When we saw how easily the city ofSan Francisco had rolled over for the 3COM deal, we knew we had anexcellent opportunity. The chance to reinforce cisco's presence in thenetworking community and the world at large is something that we justcouldn't pass up. For the price, it's quite a steal.">3COM officials declined to comment on a report that they had tried toblock the deal due to their concern that 3COM Park (formerlyCandlestick Park) would now be located in cisco, CA.>"With the number of national and international visitors, TV coverage,and the 1999 Superbowl to be held in the newly renamed city, ciscowill continue to extend its reach into every facet of the networkingworld" said the spokesman. "We are proud of the outstandingaccomplishments of our employees and partners in fiscal 1995 and wesee this as an excellent opportunity to reward them for theirdedication.">Cisco Systems, Inc. is the leading global supplier of enterprisenetworks, including routers, LAN and ATM switches, dial-up accessservers and network management software.</pre><img src="stuff/soup.sep.gif"><pre></pre><b>Net Soup Contributors:</b><br>Aaron Dickey (<a href = "mailto:kieran@interport.net">kieran@interport.net</a>)<br>Eliot Bergson (<a href="mailto:eliot@birdsong.com">eliot@birdsong.com</a>)<br>Martha Brockenbrough (<a href="mailto:mec@p.tribnet.com">mec@p.tribnet.com</a>)<pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><p><a href="../signal/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">19 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">30 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
