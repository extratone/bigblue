As expected, amusing stories are thestrongest element, but with the other stuff like interviews,this a fun way to read something interesting while youdeceive your co-workers by acting busy. Enjoy.<pre></pre><img align=left src="stuff/may.gif"><ahref="http://www.rbdc.com/~hgambill/joyce.htm">JoyceWankable</a>: "Bricolage, slumming, bang-a-can-tunes,pathetic lust" is what this zine claims to be into, and ifyou have trouble making sense of that list, then it probablyisn't for you. But if your bells go off at the mention of"do-it-yourself" (the English translation of "bricolage"),or pathetic lust, then click here, and enjoy the interviewwith "Southern Culture on the Skids," reporting from RobertAltman's editing room, and more.<pre></pre><a href="http://rs6.loc.gov/wpaintro/wpahome.html">The WPALife Histories Home Page</a>: Close to 3,000 personalhistories written from interviews made in 1936-40 make thisreally one of the most interesting sites on the Net. Youwon't find stunning graphics or self-conscious cool (exceptin some of the stories, where the New Deal journalist fervorshines through with alternately inspiring and hilariousresults), but what you will find is the near chance totalk with old folks - some wise, some crazy - who you never would have met.<pre></pre><img align=left src="stuff/prov.gif"><ahref="http://info.utas.edu.au/docs/flonta/">DeProverbia</a>: "An Electronic Journal of International Proverb Studies"coming out of Tasmania? Well, as it says, "make hell whilethe sun shines." But seriously, if you're the type thatwonders about why your family says a certain weird phraseand what others elsewhere are saying, then it might be wortha trip to Tasmania for this new, eclectic Web journal, toread such gems as, "Early to Bed and Early to Rise: FromProverb to Benjamin Franklin and Back."<p>By <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/People/Bios/Alderman.j/index.html">mrhungry</a><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../ren2.0/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">18 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">41 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
