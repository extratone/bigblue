SethFriedman</a><p>When <a href="mailto:stumangrum@aol.com">Stuart Mangrum</a>'s notconcocting fun activities for the Cacophony Society, he's usuallymaking homebrewed beer.  <img align=left src="stuff/twisted.gif">Whileall that beer is aging in his basement, Stuart scans the local pressfor weird news and sifts through the Internet, looking for the mosttwisted things for reprinting. Some of my favorite bits gleaned byStuart, and printed in the <i>Times</i> include the illustratedinstructions for becoming a part of the Barbie Liberation Organization(the group that switches the sound modules between Barbie andG. I. Joe dolls), Peter Kuper's cartoon report on the Mike Dianatrial, a program schedule showing what would happen if the GOP tookover PBS, a communiqu&eacute; from the Green Panthers (a militantmarijuana legalization group), and the <ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/twain/twisted.html">absolutely hilarious</a> "What if People BoughtCars like They Buy Computers?"<p>Sometimes a weird sense of humor is the only way to deal withhorrible events.  The darkest article in this darkly humored zine isthe cover story reporting on how a fully armed police battalion led araid on Stuart's next door neighbor.  After storming the house andputting seven bullet holes in the man, the police didn't find anytraces of the meth lab supposedly set up in the house.<p>Because Stuart is quite active in the San Francisco CacophonySociety he often reports on their many actions in <i>TwistedTimes</i>. Recently, for instance, after the 997th jumper, theCalifornia Highway Patrol announced that it would no longer assignnumbers to Golden Gate Bridge suicides, hoping to prevent "peoplelining up to be number 1,000." The Cacophony Society reacted to thisbit of news by hosting a 2-K "Race of Doom" across the bridge. Thehook - all runners would be sporting the number 1,000 on theirvests. This hilarious prank seemed to turn dark when someone tookadvantage of the opportunity and leapt to his death during therace. Or maybe he didn't. <p><b><i>Twisted Times</i></b><br> Stuart Mangrum<br> PO Box 271222<br> Concord, California94527 1222<br> <p>US$3 per issue; US$10 for four issues.</dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../ren2.0/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">18 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">41 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
