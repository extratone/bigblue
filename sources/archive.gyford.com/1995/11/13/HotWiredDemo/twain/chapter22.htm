Come night, the neighborhoods all turn a watery gray, and distinctions, though in truth they're probably sharper, seem slightly less severe. Perhaps that's why, come night, people often test them. In little spurts of fantasy, they make florid attempts to cross over into spheres they don't really know about or dress up in garb of castes they've only read of in books. Tight-assed professionals, for instance, venture down rough alleys heading to the seamiest clubs, and minimum-wage earners on dates rent limousines, wear gowns, and generally outspend their incomes. In a challenge to daylight's static hierarchies, you might step to the curb where a car is waiting, fantasizing your own celebrity and wealth or dip into street drugs otherwise reserved for the underprivileged, crashing afterward into chemical despondency as you return from a night spent slumming.<p>I walked alone along Arthur. Storefronts and tenement doorways wereinterspersed among loading docks, all under a layer of night's gray, whichdisguised the details of city life the way a painter's dropcloth hides a room.The whole town seemed blurred, degenerate. I felt free, in a nihilistic sort ofway, and, similarly, hopeful. In a gesture of resentment, I was forsaking all myfriends and associates, blaming <i>them</i> for the confusion of identities andmaddening ambiguity that had reached a peak last weekend. And the act of leavingall of that behind felt freeing. I was heading toward a different world wherenone of it would matter. It would be a whole new paradigm, filled with adifferent sort of data, a place where you could smell and see, sense moisture,feel thickness.<p>I turned the corner onto Dwight. The street looked eerily swept clean orevacuated, the site of historic dramas now long past. Only up ahead, at the veryend, there were two or three figures milling around a doorway. It was TheMansion. As I approached I saw there was no sign, just the number, 405,stencilled in white on the door and out front two huge men, the size of discusthrowers or Vikings. One wore a leather vest, the other a black jacket. "How's itgoing?" the latter asked me. The other took my money. I passed down threeconcrete steps through the doorway, then down a dozen more into what must havebeen the refurbished basement floor of a factory warehouse.<p>	And as I lingered for a minute in the foyer, ostensibly to empty out mypockets before I checked my coat, I observed distinctly in myself the first signsof calm I'd felt for ages. It was like love or courage or comfort or something,or perhaps it was just the first unfettered, fearless moment of intention I'dallowed my unmoored psyche since I'd been abandoned. Maybe it was the darkness,maybe the anonymity, but I felt as if I were online again with someone waitingfor me there. I handed my coat through the window.<p>	The club was dim, its open central room leading onto dimmer passageways,little rooms, and stairways, all of which were stirring with people - peopledressed in black, people dressed in leather, people with their shoulders bare. Ifelt my own skin against the air, which was wet like breath. The mere fact offlesh and presence, of all those surfaces, hard or pliant, made me glad, notbecause for me the physical world is necessarily reassuring or seems especiallytrue, but because I know that, in it, things can shatter. All the laudedwholeness of real, material experience - the places, trains, the individuals -were breakable. So was I. I swung my arms at my sides, just to get acquaintedwith the air moving past them. I felt unburied. This was the world, I thought.These were bones. These were wishes. These were bodies.<p>I'd passed across the main room and turned to watch the people milling. Halfcompleted, like a movie set, the area was made up to look like a large boudoir orthe mansion's parlor, with dark divans and ostentatious sofas from mismatchederas arranged alongside deep, cushioned chairs and ottomans. Several standinglamps had fringes, and, from fixtures high up on the ceiling, the light wasamber. I saw a woman straddling a seated man. She was unbuttoning his trousers.He was reaching up beneath her shirt and brushing his hands over her breasts. Ileaned against the wall. Bodies passed back and forth in front of me, but I wastoo fixed on the sounds the two were making to see where anyone else was heading.Across the way, a lanky man in an undershirt sat down on a couch to watch themalso. The woman reached into the pants of the man who was helpless beneath her;she was staring into his unblinking eyes, hovering and swaying. Her arms werebare save the leather strap buckled tightly around one bicep, and her thinstraight hair was snaking around her shoulders. Now she was reaching down withboth her hands. He was losing his focus. You knew her nipples were hard.<p>	Eventually the woman crawled down along his front, he with his handsgripping the chair behind his head, both with their torsos turning, in the goldlight, slightly reddish, and across the way the rangy man in the undershirtthrust his head back against the sofa.<p>I headed down a hallway. Several times I had stopped myself from touching thezipper of my jeans because that wasn't the way I wanted it. If I let myself getsatisfied too easily, I knew, it wouldn't really change me, it wouldn't dig infar enough, dismantle and rebuild me. I slipped into another passageway on myright. You could almost feel the hallways were elegant, if they hadn't beencrowded with half-bare men of every size and women dressed like gogo dancers,movie stars, and athletes.<p>	Up a set of wood steps was a row of low-ceilinged rooms, meant, Isupposed, to be the maids' quarters. They resembled the sort of cheap hotel arunaway might find in Paris, not now, but in a different century, and you couldimagine church bells sounding as the morning sun poured over a wooden dresser. Inone room, I saw a woman, dressed in a tiny black dress and lace-up boots, sittingon a cot-like bed, sucking in huge gulps of air filled with fear and pleasure.Two others, like herself skinny and austere, stood above her, to the left a paleman, slight and effeminate, to the right a black woman with dozens of braids. Butwhat made me stop and stand abruptly in the doorway of the little room was therope the "butler" was uncoiling. It was long and coarse and silver. On the bed,the small woman breathed harder as they gently leaned her back, and her shortblond hair looked almost slick from perspiring. I stared intently at those wristsas the delicate man took his time, flipping the cord once, then twice, threetimes around the bed frame. Alternately, her hand grew tense, fumbled for therope, then dangled. And when they unlaced her boots and coiled that rope aroundher ankles, her whole body grew hard, then slack, as she alternately struggledand surrendered. Her captors moved more and more deliberately, while theystrapped her down and contemplated what was next, and I knew then, as I watchedthe scene unfolding, that somehow, before I headed home that night, I would begfor something.<p>The farther back you went, the darker it became. One room - it must have beenintended as the master's suite - was lit with red. A smooth-skinned white manwith long muscles and brown curls was lying naked on the bed, perfectly immobile.Across the room another man, this one Asian and stocky, sat squarely in a plusharm chair, his skin bathed in the red light, watching.<p>Then as the little hallway turned sharply, a sort of lobby, itself muchbrighter, served to introduce the darkest room of any. Its double doors wereopen, but the high-ceilinged, final space was too dark at first to see in. Itswalls were painted black, its rugless floor solid shadow. What was this? Iconjectured; the stable? Or the cellar? Leaning up against the door frame,peering in, I could make out nothing but what seemed like extra roof beamscriss-crossing in the corners, several high black benches and a few vague pairsof people. I could hear a shuffling, I could feel a blast of ventilation, but Icouldn't see what they were doing.<p>	Just then, fast like an accident, sudden like a theft, the sort of shockor disaster that produces a groan in your rib cage and a whiteness in your mind -erasure - I felt a bruising grip around my wrist and a yanking at my arm. Someonehad pulled me into the darkness. I stumbled, barely righting myself beforefalling face first to the floor. A knee was forced between my thighs, hands at myshoulders as if bolting me to the wall. It all had the fury and speed of a raid.I caught a breath, like the silence after sirens pass, and closed my eyes. "Yes,"I said aloud, though I had no idea to what. This, whatever <i>this</i> was goingto be, was what I wanted.</blockquote><pre></pre><pre><p align=center><ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/twain/serial_indices/francesca.4.html"><b>P r e v i o u s   C h a p t e r s</a></pre></b><pre></pre><pre><p align=center>B y   <ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/People/Bios/Baer.m/"><b>M a r t h a   B a e r</b></a></pre><pre><p align=center>A r t   b y   <ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/People/Bios/Urbank.moses/"><b>D.
