Not just anybody's bile,either, but sickening, green foamy beer bile pumped from the stomach and outthrough the nose of Matt the Tube, a member of the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow,also performing on the tour. The disgusting contest continued all summerlong, until eventually Vedder won. <p>Congratulations, I guess.<p>Like its older grunge rock brothers, the Jim Rose Circus also spawned from thedamp, espresso-fueled confines of Seattle to infect the world with their shockingblend of traditional sideshow and "modern primitive" spectacle. <i>Freak LikeMe</i> documents the evolution of this masochistic bunch, who went fromperforming at a small Portland book reading by <i>Geek Love</i> author KatherineDunn, all the way up to a recent world tour with Nine Inch Nails. Readers alsotrace the life of its founder Jim Rose, who survived a cross-eyed Arizonachildhood, honed his storytelling skills as a car salesman and bug exterminator,and found his calling as a sideshow performer on the boardwalk in Venice,California. <p>Rose makes no claim to creating literature here, but his often-hilariouscircus barker voice makes a seamless transition to the page, referring tofainting audience members as "falling ovations," or introducing Mr. Lifto'spierced penis as the "part of him that's most a mister." <p>"It's a strange way to make a living," Rose admits, "and my dentist has mademe cut down on eating light bulbs, but I'm never bored." <p>If all else fails, he can move to Florida and write for the tabloids.<p><b><i>Freak Like Me: Inside the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow</i></b><br>Jim Rose with Melissa Rossi<br>200 pages, US$13.95<br>Dell, 1995<br></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../ren2.0/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="jim.rose.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">18 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">41 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
