The truth, as Jeffrey T. Richelson lays out zealouslyin his tubby new hardback, is that there are snoops in the shadows, <img align=right src="stuff/spys.gif">cameras inthe skies, wires in the toilets, tapes on the telephone, bombs in the bath, andtransmitters under the bed. In this era of intrigue, everyone and anything can bepaid enough to peep at their neighbors, and sometimes to shoot, too.<p>Beginning with simple 19th-century German double agents, <i>A Century of Spies- Intelligence in the Twentieth Century</i> rolls along with the development ofmodern espionage with a casually organized barrage of names, dates, and facts.Morals go out the window as Nixon plots a bloody coup in Chile, Israel guns downits hidden enemies in Europe, and France steals computer secrets from IBM, andbombs anti-nuke protesters in New Zealand. One of the extremely outlandishprojects outlined by Richelson, a Senior Fellow of the National Security Archive,involves a secret air-conditioned 500-yard tunnel beneath East Berlin that tappedphone lines at the Soviet airport and spewed 1,200 hours of tape a day back toWashington, DC.<p>Information makes war bloodless, leaving victories to diplomats andtacticians, as both sides look into the whites of each others eyes and scrutinizethe DNA and blood type. Soldiers and battleships become important for their paperand political value, while presidents in South America fall victim to strangepoisons and intrigue. With oodles of reconnaissance information, superpowerslearn better than to risk self-destruction, but they meddle with spheres ofinfluence and cause catastrophe nonetheless. Though covert enterprise may beridiculous and indicative of all the worst traits of humanity, spying andsecurity seem to define normal relations just by their presence. Even though wehave no warnings, virtually all of our transactions are insecure, and may beviewed by third parties while in transit.<p><b><i>A Century of Spies - Intelligence in the Twentieth Century</i></b><br>Jeffrey T.
