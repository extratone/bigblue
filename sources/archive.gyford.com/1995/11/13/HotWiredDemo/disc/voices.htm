The problem isn't whether players can make awrong decision about the roles of money and authority in their game... it's a question of who does the deciding.<p>In big-ticket sports, team owners and tournament sponsors shape theevolution of games. They decide which hockey player goes to thepenalty box, which basketball player steps up to the free-throw line,and how hard one football player can slam another. Do you want Coorsor Chevron to buy an Ultimate team and call the shots?  Do you wantnonplayers to decide if Ultimate is going to go along with the refereemodel used in other sports? If you do, say goodbye to the <ahref="index.htm">UPA</a>.<p>Let's not kid ourselves. People play Ultimate because it's fun, but alsobecause it's easy. The game is built around what is basically a <ahref="index.htm"> children's toy</a>.Cleats? OK. Spandex too, if you can pull it off. But you don't needcustom-trimmed Astroturf, fancy equipment - or referees. To bring in refereeswould be to hand over responsiblility for the game. Not only would we give upwhat makes Ultimate fun to play, we would surrender the ability to shape thegrowth of the sport.<h3>The Responsibility of Competition</h3><p>I show up with my shoes down for one of the goal markers and grabthe disc out of my trunk. I like Ultimate because it's not a contactsport, and the people I play with aren't out for blood. But sometimes,instead of releasing tension on the field, I find myself more uptightafter the game than before. The shouts of offensive and defensivestrategies give way to trash-talking and dirt-kicking. I may soundlike a Polyanna, but I like to play disc with people who can cope withthe responsibility of competition.<p>There are attitudes forming in the Ultimate community that promoteadding official referees to tournaments. But I hear a phrase like"real sport," and I think membership fees, lines painted on the field,and men in black and white.  For the club teams that practice hoursevery day, increased regulation of tournament games may mean moreintense play and more fun. But I see self-refereed Ultimate as aunique form of competition in the world of sports, even at thenational level. If I legislate away the responsibility of making myown calls, I give up what brought me to the game in the first place.<p><a href="index.htm">Real Audio</a>: <br> Ultimateplayer Charlie Glickman tells us why disc players are more reponsiblethan hockey players or basketball players.<p> Ultimate player Christina Castagna admits she likes men in Lycratights better than men in black and white</a> <p>Story by Matt Margolin<br> Sound gathered by Ancel Martinez and Chris Arnold</a> </table> <pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">7 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">2 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/disc/95/41/index2a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
