The top seeds in all classes from the sixRegional tournaments qualified for the UPA National ChampionshipTournament, to be held in <ahref="index.htm">Birmingham,Alabama</a>, from 2-5 November. In the Women's competition, <ahref="index.htm">Ozone</a>took the Southern Regional and <ahref="index.htm">WomenOn the Verge</a> qualified in Olympia.<p>These two could replay last July's World Championship match - butPhat City, <ahref="index.htm">LadyGodiva</a>, and other fine qualifiers may not let that happen.<p>The biggest event of the weekend wasn't on the field but took placeon the Net in <a href="news:rec.sport.disc">rec.sport.disc</a>, wheremembers of the combative men's teams spent more time grumbling abouteach other's behavior than chatting about fine tourney play. Most ofthe venom was directed at Port City, which was slammed by thecompetition for its testy posturing and name-calling. On the field,Port City, Cojones, and world club champs <ahref="index.htm">DoubleHappiness</a> are the favorites to wrest the Open Crown from lastyear's champs, DoG, who qualified for Nationals, placing second in theNortheast region.<p>Birmingham awaits, with camellia laurels for the victors.<pre></pre><p>Story by <a href="mailto:mattmarg@hotwired.com">Matt Margolin</a><br>Photo by Rick Collins</table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/cgi-bin/users/imagemap/disc/footer/mainbar_member.map"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">7 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">2 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
