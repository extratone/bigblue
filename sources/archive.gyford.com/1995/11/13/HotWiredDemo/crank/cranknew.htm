This order willbe legal and enforceable, if proposed legislation currently before theUS Congress doesn't receive a quick edit.<p> <a href="index.htm">Senator Pete Domenici</A> (R-New Mexico), author of theproposed <a href="index.htm">PublicRangelands Act</A>, claims he will eliminate language in the bill thatcould allow ranchers to bar recreational users, including mountainbikers, from using public lands. Domenici has yet to make good on hispromise, however.<p>Story by Jackson Lynch<pre></pre><td><tr><td valign=top><img src="stuff/bike.lanes.gif"><td colspan=2><h4>What's Next? <br>Outlawing Cars?</h4><tr><td><td>An outbreak of common sense that swept through the western UnitedStates this summer has some cyclists fearing global sanity could benext.<p>In California, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District isputting up more than half a million dollars for two new bikeways, ninemiles of bike lanes, and a bicyclist hotline in <Ahref="index.htm">SanFrancisco</A>.<p> Further north, an appellate court ruling in Oregon will make biketransportation a priority, despite state budget restrictions. Thecourt directed Oregon to spend no less than one percent of federalhighway monies on improvements for bicyclists.<p> <A href="index.htm">Hawaii</A> mustbe watching its neighbors, because it will also require theinstallation of bike facilities whenever a road is built orimproved. The Aloha state, however, hasn't mandated any minimumspending requirements.<p>Story by Josh Wilson</table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">8 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">7 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
