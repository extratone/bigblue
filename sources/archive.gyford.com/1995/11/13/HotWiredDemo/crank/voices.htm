You'd knowthat if you saw me. I grew up in Mill Valley, north of San Francisco, at the baseof Mount Tamalpais. It's the place "where it all began, man" - as a guy fromKansas City once told me.<p>In those early days of mountain biking, my buddies and I rode because we werekids, and it was fun. I used to push my <Ahref="index.htm">BMX</A> up fire roads, then turn around andfly down, <ahref="index.htm">stacking</a> all theway. I quickly grew out of my BMX, and into a <Ahref="index.htm">Schwinn</A> Cruiser - the kind withhuge handlebars and a big, cozy seat. By then, Gary Fisher and friends hadalready began selling their homemade bikes, and establishing Mount Tam as theoff-road Mecca.<p> I graduated from my big clunker to my first mountain bike when I was in highschool. It was a <Ahref="index.htm">Specialized RockhopperComp</A>, and I loved it. My mom knew that <i>that</i> beauty was gonna take meto new heights and speeds, and she gave me a helmet to protect my melon. Ideveloped a real love for bombing down single-tracks. My buddies and I wouldhitchhike to the top, and explore the trails on the way down. It was the best.<p>After high school, I left Tam behind. I went to <Ahref="index.htm">college</A> in Eugene, Oregon, partly because ofthe excellent riding I'd heard about. My buddies and I rode before class, afterclass, and often instead of class. We'd "fat man it," leaving one car at thebottom of the trail, and taking the bikes in another car to the top. The trailswere in secluded hills, close to campus, and we hardly ever saw any other bikersor hikers.<p>I graduated recently, and came back home to find my beloved mountain taintedby its own popularity. Mountain biking's success has been its downfall on Tam,as the mountain has become the hub of a huge industry. <img border=0 align=right src="stuff/crank.2nd.gif">Riding up the mountain isno longer the nirvana I remember, and Tam has been closed off to any realsingle-track biking. It's like Yosemite Valley - there's no way to avoid thecrowds - and you've got to listen to business people brokering deals, taking uptrail space with their $3,000 bikes.<p>Sure, Sunday bikers can still squeeze into their neon Lycra, hop onto theiroverpriced, underutilized bikes, and careen around the fire roads all they want(under 15 mph, of course), but I'll never be able return to the Tam that made mefall in love with the sport, riding with my pals.<p></table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/adrenaline/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/crank/index.html"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">9 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">9 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
