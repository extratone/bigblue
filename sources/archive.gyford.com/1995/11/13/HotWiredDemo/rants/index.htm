I have been on the net for over a decade and I'm still not sure what the point of thisthing is.  Though I will admit to having that greatoldtimers disease of always posting what I think at the moment.<p><img src="stuff/unix.gif" width=150 height=80 align=right>The net has always been crowded with nostalgia.when forum and later IRC were invented I remeber thinkinghow much cooler the old relay chat used to be on the Vaxen.Other examples include everyone whining about the goodold days before the alt.* groups.  <p>The net has always been just around the corner.It seems like since when I started using the net in the 80s till now everyone has been predicting that the net will suddenly take off and become profitable "real soon now."<p>I remember being annoyed at the constant influxof Newbies who didn't know what was going on back in themid 80s when at the time any one from a .com site wassuspect.  Then suddenly it was anyone from a .edu site.Later it would be the well and netcom.  Now of course it's AOL that's the weenieville of the moment and soonprolly Microsoft.  I'm still surprised it isn't .gov.<p>All I know is that there never was a golden age, from 84 till now the net has always been a mess that waseither going to die, be censored, or become marketableany day now.</ul><pre></pre><H3>T H R E A D : <A HREF="https://archive.gyford.com/soundz/">Soundz</A><BR><A HREF="../threads/index.htm">T O P I C : Jerry Garcia (1942-1995)</a><BR></H3><ul><B>An inspiration from the past</B><BR><B><A href="index.htm">Jonathan		 Golub</A> (<A HREF="mailto:alijon@sirius.com">alijon</A>)</B> on Thu, 10 Aug 95 13:52 PST<P><img align=right src="stuff/jerry.gif" width=80 height=160><p>I remember back when I was 15 or 16, I was pretty into the dead but had only seen a few shows.I was at summer camp when we heard the news about Jerry<img align=middle src="stuff/jerry.gif" width=20 height=25> being in a coma.  My friends and I sat around wondering what would happen if he were to die."Imagine all the deadheads jumping off the <a href="index.htm">Golden Gate bridge</a>!"<p>Thankfully, he pulled out of his funk.  He had more music to play (and more milkshakes to drink.)  By waking up he gave me the opportunity to see many amazing shows.  The Grateful Dead and their culture gave me the inspiration to try new things.  To <a href="index.htm">lick</a> new things.  To explore my mind in a psychedelic communal context.I still see their influence all around me, and I give them more than a little credit for inspiring me to create music, a source of great happiness in my life.  Jerry<img src="stuff/jerry.gif" width=20 height=25> is sort of a patron saint to freaks and outcasts - this society needs more characters like that.  I find it hard to get super-wistful, because of the negative aspects that turned me off from Dead culture - conformity, laziness, blind idealism - but the Fat Man<img align=middle src="stuff/jerry.gif" width=40 height=25> will always be an inspiration, not just for his music, but for the zeal with which he lived life.  <p>And if I could do one tenth of the drugs he did between now and <b>my</b> 53'd birthday, I would die a happy man.</ul><pre></pre><H3>T H R E A D : <A HREF="../soundz/index.htm">Soundz</A></H3><A HREF="../threads/index.htm"><ul><B>Front 24 who?</a></B><BR><B>kim adams (neonjane)</B> on Tue, 8 Aug 95 10:42 PST<P><PRE>What happened to industrial music???

Perhaps for thatpart of the population that is interested and engaged in politics,the online media will become the primary source of information(TV has never been adequate).<p>Or, maybe the role of the new media will be to discussissues and hold debates among small numbers of people that arereported to the masses in the old media.  If so,the new media will have far more political infuence than purenumbers or dollar amounts would show, and may force theold media to cover issues that the publishers would prefer toavoid.  At least, that was the model that was working in theRimm debate.<p>Re: Stahlman's comment in #5, in evaluating the Web's potential,I'd encourage you to lookbeyond what's available with the current browsers.  In the caseof responding in Threads, there's no technical reason whythe primitive editing available in Netscape and Mosaic's&lt;textarea> fields can't be replaced by a real wordprocessor (preferably one chosen by the user), should the browsercompanies decide that's important.  Also, HTML 3.0 and Java willallow more powerful "form" interfaces.</ul><pre></pre><H3>T H R E A D : <A HREF="https://archive.gyford.com/Signal/Market/index.html">Market Forces</A><BR><A HREF="../threads/index.htm">T O P I C : Disney buys Cap Cities/ABC</a><BR></H3><ul><B>My take on the recent mergers</B><BR><B><A href="index.htm">Eugene Bradley</A> (<A HREF="mailto:ebradley@pegasus.rutgers.edu">enice</A>)</B> on Thu, 3 Aug 95 13:25 PST<P><P>Given the mergers of Disney/ABC and Westinghouse/CBS,here's my take on the pros and cons of each of themergers mean, using the Disney/ABC mergerpotential aspects as an example:</p><P><B>Pros</b></p><P><ul><li><i>Increased family entertainment</i>.  Isn't it ironic    that in 1954, ABC -- then a fledgling network similar    to what UPN & The WB are today -- lent Walt Disney &amp; Co. $5 million to    build the original Disneyland, only to have Disney     buy them only 41 years later?  Now that Disney -- a    company that basically symbolizes family values --    bought out ABC, we may likely see more family shows    such as a possible Parent Trap series (this is something    I'm making up here -- excuse me if this is actually in    the works), and fewer sex &amp; violence-oriented shows    such as <a href="index.htm">    NYPD Blue</a>.<li><i>Better Saturday morning shows</i>.  IMHO ever since    the Superfriends went off ABC's Saturday morning lineup    in the mid-1980's, the overall quality of Saturday mor-    nings on AlphabetNet(tm) has dropped.  The only    sign of <B>ANY</b> resurgance of Saturday morning    strength on ABC is <a href="index.htm">    Reboot</a> -- and even then some stations s<i>Reboot</i>    too early in the morning for most children to wake up,     if at all.  IMHO if Disney wants to turn ABC's     Saturday morning into <a href="index.htm">    the Disney Afternoon</a> II: Saturday Mornings, it should    have ABC renew Reboot.</ul></p><P><B>Cons</b></p><P><ul><li><i>Exclusivity</i>.  The last <b>pro</b> can be    reversed.  By potentially making all of ABC's     Saturday Morning lineup all-Disney, you are ultimately    taking away the viewer's choice of production quality.    I mean, there are some children I know of that like    <i>Exo-Squad</i> and <i>Biker Mice from Mars</i> more    than <i>Free Willy</i> or <i>Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue    Rangers</i>.<li><i>A potentially ugly logo</i>.  You thought the    logo for <a href="index.htm">CBS</a> was    simple but ugly -- the NY Post featured the ABC logo    with <i>ears</i> on it and it looked tacky.  I can    also imagine Hank Williams teaming with Mickey Mouse    singing "Are You Ready for some football?"    every time Monday Night Football comes on.</ul></p><P>Now awaiting the Disney Broadcasting Company (DBC) to air...</p><p>---eugene</p></ul><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../piazza/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
