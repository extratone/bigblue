Since 1992,Tunick has asked friends, fans, and freaks to strip and pose for morethan 150 shoots on city streets from New York to London toJerusalem. Outside the United Nations, for example, Tunick wrapped 25nudes in a plastic sheet for his own "General Assembly."  The models'pay is always the same - a signed print and a good story to tell.        <p>"At the beginning, I think my photos were more dreamy andwhimsical," Tunick says, several hours after the San Franciscoshoot. "Then they became more socially conscious. In my latestpictures, I've tried to juxtapose the human condition against themetal cars and the pavement, the softness of the human body againstthe hardness of the streets."<p>Visiting the Bay Area for an opening at a local gallery featuringanother body of his work, Tunick passed out a few handwritten fliersannouncing today's <i>Naked Pavement</i> shoot. A dozen brave soulsturned up this morning to grin and bare it.       <pre></pre><pre><a href="http:stuff/do.it.this.way.jpeg"><img src="stuff/do.it.this.way.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/retina/stuff/the.photographer.jpeg"><img src="stuff/the.photographer.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/retina/stuff/naked.in.street.jpeg"><img src="stuff/naked.in.street.gif"></a></pre><pre></pre><p> "Thanks for coming," Tunick says excitedly as he approaches hismodels, breaking their sleepy silence with a smile. "OK. We should bequick. What I want everyone to do is lie end to end on the doubleyellow line of this hill with your eyes open and your hands and feetat your sides. Like this."        <p>As Tunick drops to the ground to demonstrate, the nervouslyfidgeting group pays close attention. Once the artist is certain hisvision is understood, he darts into the intersection to take lightreadings.        <p>"If you're not posing, can you please stand in the street and blocktraffic?" he politely asks one of the more modest visitors standing onthe sidelines. "If anyone has boots on, they should take them offnow. After this next wave of traffic, we'll do it."<p align=center><img src="stuff/the.shoot.gif"><p>While Tunick has orchestrated shoots with more than 100 people nudeon the street, he has only been arrested once. Last December, he and amale model were charged with public lewdness, disorderly conduct, andtrespassing after Tunick photographed the man <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/retina/nude.html">naked</a> and draped on a giant Christmas treeornament outside of Rockefeller Center.        <p>"Sometimes I feel like I'm in a videogame, where I'm a blip on thescreen and I have to stay away from the police, homeless people, andcabs while I run around the city shooting nudes," Tunick explainslater. "If I get the shoot done, I win."        <p>Quickly glancing up and down the road, Tunick gives the word and hismodels don't hesitate to drop their drawers. In a blur of flesh, they raceinto the street and align themselves on the cold asphalt.       <p>"Arms together! Arms together! Take off your glasses! Eyes open!" Tunickshouts above blaring car horns.        <p>As Tunick snaps through his roll of film, taxi drivers peer out of theirwindows, unimpressed. This is San Francisco, shrugs one cabby. A bellmanfrom a nearby hotel casually asks if the shoot is for a postcard while ajogger does a triple-take without breaking her stride.        <p>Two minutes later, Tunick yells that he's finished and the grinning groupmakes a mad dash to the pile of clothes on the sidewalk. No arrests. Noinjuries. Only a few halfhearted wolf-whistles from a trio of confusedconstruction workers who missed most of the action. <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/retina/stuff/passageway.jpeg"><p align=center><img src="stuff/passageway.gif"></a><p><h4>Spencer Tunick's next <i>Naked Pavement</i> photo shoot will take place1 October at 6:45 a.m. in New York on 13th Street between Washington Street and the West Side Highway.
