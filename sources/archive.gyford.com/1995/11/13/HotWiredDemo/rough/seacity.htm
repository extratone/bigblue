The fabulous views over ElliottBay, too, help to lighten the feel - best perused from along <b>thewaterfront</b>, despite its clutter of tourist shops. <p>	From downtown, you can ride the monorail north to the <b>SeattleCenter</b>, where the futuristic, flying-saucer-topped tower of the <b>SpaceNeedle</b> presides over an assortment of theaters, museums and the operahouse. To the south, the distinctive concrete bulk of the <b>Kingdome</b>sports arena/concert hall maroons the small Southeast Asian-dominated<b>International District</b> behind its stretch of parking lots. Further southstill, the huge <b>Museum of Flight</b> charts the development of air travelfrom Icarus on. <p>	A couple of outlying districts tend to be livelier than downtown:<b>Capitol Hill</b> has caf&eacute;s and bars which form the heart of thecity's gay scene (and holds some of the best city parks); and the <b>UniversityDistrict</b> is, as you'd expect, a students' district of cheap caf&eacute;swith some uptempo nightlife.<p><a href="seacity.htm#pike">Pike Place Market and the Waterfront</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#museum">Seattle Art Museum</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#pioneer">Pioneer Square and around</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#chinatown">Chinatown/International District</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#flight">The Museum of Flight</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#southwest">Southwest to Alki Beach</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#center">The Seattle Center</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#capitol">Capitol Hill</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#university">The University District</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#lake">Lake Washington Canal, Ballard and other northern parts oftown</a><br><a href="seacity.htm#washington">Lake Washington and the eastern outskirts</a><br><pre></pre><h3><a name="pike">Pike Place Market and the Waterfront</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote><b>Pike Place Market</b>, at the bottom of Pike Street, is rightly downtownSeattle's biggest attraction. Buskers and street entertainers play to busycrowds, smells of coffee drift from the caf&eacute;s, and stalls are piled highwith lobsters, crabs, salmon, vegetables and fruit. Further into the longmarket building, craft stalls sell handmade jewellery, woodcarvings andsilk-screen printing, while small shops stock a massive range of ethnic foods.<p>	Farmers first brought their produce here in 1907, lowering food prices byselling straight from the barrow. The market boomed in the poverty-strickenyears of the Depression, but by the Sixties it had become shabby and neglected,and the authorities decided to flatten the area altogether. Architect VictorSteinbrueck led a horrified protest: he wanted to preserve theturn-of-the-century buildings, and, more importantly, the whole character ofthe market as a source of affordable provisions for the elderly and the poor.There was a period of confrontation between the two lobbies, but in 1971Seattlites voted overwhelmingly to keep the market. Now restored, it stillprovides low-priced food, thereby preserving its roots - though, perhapsinevitably, upscale restaurants catering to tourists and local yuppies are fastcreeping in, undeterred by the surrounding area's porno theaters and teenageprostitutes.<p>	Stairs in the market lead down to the <b>Hillclimb</b>, which descendspast more shops and caf&eacute;s to the <b>Waterfront</b>. The harbor's nolonger deep enough for modern ocean-going ships, and much of the old waterfronthas been turned over to the tourist trade while the port's real business goeson to the north and south. Almost opposite the Hillclimb, <b>Pier 59</b> is oneof a line of old wooden jetties which once served the tall ships; it now housesSeattle's <b>Aquarium</b> (daily summer 10am-7pm, winter 10am-5pm; $6.50),which provides some lively information on marine life in the Sound, anunderwater viewing dome and a pool of playful sea otters and seals. A combinedticket (for $10.80) also admits you to <b>Omnidome</b> next door (daily10am-8.30pm; $5.95 for two films), showing films featuring clever graphics, ornatural dramas such as the eruption of Mount St Helens.<p>	South of Pier 59, the waterfront is lined with souvenir shops, restaurantsand fish and chips stands, the most famous of which - though it has declinedsince the death of owner-founder Ivar Haglund - <i>Ivar's Acres of Clams</i>,comes complete with its own special stop ("Clam Central Station") on the<b>waterfront streetcar</b> (85cents), which carries tourists along the bay inrestored vintage carriages. The waterfront gets back to business at Pier 52,where <b>Colman Dock</b> is the terminal for the <i>Washington StateFerries</i> (see "Listings" for ferry information), and a good place to watchthem pull in and out - though it can get somewhat frantic in the rush hour withcommuters crossing from suburban homes over the bay.<pre></pre><h3><a name="museum">Seattle Art Museum</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>100 University St. Tues, Wed, Fri &amp; Sat 10am-5pm, Thurs10am-9pm, Sun noon-5pm. $5.<p>Close to Pike Place Market down along First Avenue, the gleamingly new<b>Seattle Art Museum </b>was completed in 1991 to a design by Robert Venturi.The Philadelphian architect took his commission seriously: he wanted to createa museum which was "popular yet esoteric, closed but open, [and] monumental yetinviting". To effect his purpose, Venturi's limestone- and terracotta-facedbuilding has a 48-foot <i>Hammering Man</i> sculpture plonked outside the frontdoor as a "tribute to the working man". <p>	Inside the four-story building, a grand staircase leads from the lobby tothe upper galleries, under the watchful eye of Chinese sculptures of camels,rams and guards. The second level is given over to temporary exhibitions andthe third - and most diverting - boasts an eclectic collection of African,Asian, Oceanian, Levantine and Native American pieces: among many, there areextraordinary masks and fetishes from Guinea and Congo, and, from the PacificNorthwest, rattles and clappers, gargoyle-like wooden pipes, canoes, prowornaments, more dancing masks and several enormous totem poles from BritishColumbia. The fourth floor traces the development of "Art in Europe and theUnited States", beginning with a handful of ancient Mediterranean artefacts,but the modern stuff is more eye-catching, mostly in its awfulness and/orinaccessibility. Look out for the elemental <i>Coloured Shouting</i> of Gilbertand George with a script that reads "The decadent artists stand for themselvesand their chosen few. . . a crude denial of the life of the people".<pre></pre><h3><a name="pioneer">Pioneer Square and around</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>Walk a few blocks inland from the ferry terminal and you come to <b>PioneerSquare</b> (actually an area of a few blocks focusing on First Avenue andYesler Way) - Seattle's oldest section and another spot that had a close brushwith the demolition balls of the Sixties. The restoration work is more glossyhere than at Pike Place Market, and the square's old red brick, black wroughtiron and heavy stonework bear the unmistakable hallmark of a well-tendedhistoric district, with bookstores and galleries adding a veneer ofsophistication. Rock music resounds from a group of lively taverns at night, but by day there's little evidence of the more rumbustiousaspects of the city's past. It was here in the mid-1800s that Henry Yeslererected the Puget Sound's first steam-powered sawmill, felling trees at the topof a nearby hill and rolling the logs down what's now Yesler Way, and was thenknown as the "skid road". Drunks and down-and-outs gathered here in the lateryears of the Depression and the term "skid row" passed into its present usage -or at least that's Seattle's version. <p>	The whole district was razed in 1889 when a pot of boiling glue turnedover in a cabinetmaker's shop and set the wooden buildings and streets ablaze.Rebuilding, the city resolved an unsavory problem with the sewage system (whichhad a nasty habit of flowing in reverse when the tide was high in the bay) byregrading the level of the land, with the result that entrances to thesurviving brick buildings now came in at the old first-floor level. The groundfloors, now below the earth, connected by underground passages, became aliteral underworld that was soon a prime location for illicit activities (suchas drinking during Prohibition). These passages were reopened in the Sixties,and can be explored on the 90-minute <b>Underground Tours</b> which leave moreor less once an hour (late morning to mid-afternoon) from <i>Doc Maynard's</i>tavern, 610 First Ave (682-4646 for times and reservations; $5.50) -by far the most amusing way to find out about Seattle's seamy past, with wittyguides taking an offbeat look at the city's history before leading youunderground.<p>	A couple of blocks from <i>Doc Maynard</i>'s, at 117 South Main St, the<b>Klondike Gold Rush National Park</b> (daily 9am-5pm; free) is not a park atall, but a small museum where a free film and a few artefacts portray the 1897rush which followed the discovery of gold in the Klondike region of Canada. As soon as the first ship carrying Klondike gold docked in the city,Seattle's sharp-eyed capitalists espied massive trading potential in sellinggroceries, clothing, sledges and even ships to the gold-seekers, and launched aformidable publicity campaign, bombarding inland cities with propaganda billingSeattle above all other ports as the gateway to Yukon gold. It worked:prospectors streamed in, merchants (and con-men) scented easy profit, thepopulation escalated and traders made a fortune. The dog population fared lesswell, as many a hapless mutt was harnessed to a sledge while gold-seekerspractised "mushing" up and down Seattle's streets before facing Yukon snow.Jack London's novel <i>The Call of the Wild</i> puts the canine point of view,and gold fever is gloriously sent up in the Charlie Chaplin film <i>The GoldRush</i> - shown free at the museum on weekend afternoons.<p>	Almost opposite the museum, the large cobblestoned square of <b>OccidentalPark</b> - with its off-putting groups of the drunk and destitute - displaysfour recently erected totem poles carved with the grotesque, almost cruel,features of creatures from Northwest Native American legends. <p><b>The business district</b><br>At the corner of Yesler Way and Second Ave, Seattle's first skyscraper, thewhite terracotta-trimmed <b>Smith Tower</b>, edges the city's financialdistrict. Built in 1914 by the New York typewriter mogul, L C Smith, the towerwas, for years, the tallest building west of the Mississippi. Today it mostlyholds private offices, but if you're passing it's worth looking in on theelegant lobby, decked out with marble and carved Indian heads. Restoredbrass-lined elevators serve an observation deck at the top, although it's oftenclosed to the public. To the north, the prestigious new glassy office blocks ofthe business district loom over the Smith Tower - not on the whole an invitingsight, although the <b>Rainier Tower</b>, balanced on a narrow pedestal atFourth Ave and University, and the dark, 76-story <b>Columbia Center</b>, atFourth Ave and Columbia, the tallest of the towers (and aptly nicknamed the"Darth Vader building" or "the box the Space Needle came in"), have passinginterest as engineering feats.<pre></pre><h3><a name="chinatown">Chinatown/International District</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>A few blocks south of Pioneer Square, your way is blocked by the hugeconcrete <b>Kingdome</b>, Seattle's main sports and concerts arena, and thehome of its Seahawks football team and Mariners<i> </i>baseball team. TheKingdome's spread of parking lots seems to signal an end to the downtown area,but pushing on east up S Jackson St, past the redbrick clocktower of the oldrailway station, the concrete expanses soon give way to the build-up ofrestaurants and ethnic grocers of Seattle's <b>Chinatown</b> - officially (andblandly) labelled the <b>International District</b> due to the presence ofother far-eastern groups. Aside from some good restaurants, for a city with astrong history of Southeast Asian immigration it's a rundown and rather scrappyneighborhood, its tawdry blocks dotted with streetpeople and few actual sights.<p>	Seattle's Chinatown hasn't always been desolate. In the nineteenth centurythis was an overcrowded and unruly district, its boarding houses crammed withyoung Chinese men who'd come over to earn money in the city's mills andcanneries. Suspicion of the area's gambling halls and opium dens overflowedinto racial hatred during a depression in the 1880s: federal laws debarred theChinese from full citizenship and in the Northwest, Chinese workers wereattacked and threatened, their homes burned. The Seattle authorities dideventually rake up an armed guard which made a belated and botched attempt toprevent mobs expelling the entire community (as happened in Tacoma), but mostChinese left anyway, leaving behind a depleted and scarred population. Laterinfluxes of Japanese, Filipino, Korean and Thai immigrants, and more recentlyVietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian newcomers, went some way to restoring a traceof the district's nineteenth-century vigor, but Chinatown has been regardedlocally with some trepidation - partly due to increasing gang activity. Inreality the area is more shabby than unsafe, though it is best to take careafter dark. The focus of the district, insofar as it has one, is <b>Hing HayPark</b> at Maynard and South King St, where an ornate oriental gateway standsbeneath a large and rather faded dragon mural. But there's not really anythingelse to see beyond the absorbing little <b>Wing Luke Asian Museum</b> at 407Seventh Ave and Jackson St (Tues-Fri 11am-4.30pm, Sat &amp; Sun noon-4pm,closed Mon; $2.50, free Thurs), which goes some way to explaining localAsian-American history, with reference to the career of Wing Luke, the firstChinese-American to be elected to public office in Seattle, in 1962. <pre></pre><h3><a name="flight">The Museum of Flight</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>9404 E Marginal Way. Daily 10am-5pm, until 9pm Thurs; $5.<p>The best and biggest of Seattle's museums, the <b>Museum of Flight</b> morethan makes up for the twenty-minute bus ride (#174) south from downtown throughthe port's dreary industrial hinterland. As the birthplace of the Boeingcompany, Seattle has its own stake in aviation history, and has investedheavily in this huge museum, partly housed in the 1909 "Red Barn" that wasBoeing's original manufacturing plant. The displays, accompanied by detailedinformation plaques and three separate filmshows, take in everything from thedreams of the ancients, through the work of the Wright brothers, with a workingmodel of the wind-tunnel they used, to the growth of Boeing itself, with partof the Red Barn laid out as an early designer's workshop. The best bit of themuseum is the huge glass-and-steel Great Gallery, big as a football field andhung with twenty full-sized aircraft - tiny, fragile-looking mail planes and ared sportscar that can apparently be given wings in minutes. There's also areplica of the Mercury space capsule that took John Glenn into space in 1962.Behind the gallery, museum staff hand out eggboxes and plasticine for theconstruction of model planes - one way to learn aerodynamics.<pre></pre><h3><a name="southwest">Southwest to Alki Beach</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>Southwest of downtown, on the other side of Elliott Bay (take bus #37 fromdowntown), the flat little peninsula of <b>Alki Point</b> is where Seattle'sfounders first tried to settle when they weighed anchor in the Puget Sound,optimistically christening their community "New York Alki" - New York "by andby" in the Chinook language. Defeated by floods and the lack of space, the townsoon shifted over to what's now Pioneer Square, changing its name to Seattleafter a friendly neighborhood chief. The peninsula's now a residentialdistrict, interesting only if you want to join the promenaders and cyclistsalong the narrow strip of <b>Alki Beach</b>, which offers pleasing views ofElliott Bay with the city skyline behind and the Olympic Mountains to the west.You can swim here too, but the water's pretty cold.<pre></pre><h3><a name="center">The Seattle Center</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>As you head north from Pike Place Market, downtown peters out aroundVirginia Street, beyond which lies a district once occupied by Denny Hill andnow flattened into the <b>Denny Regrade</b>. Considering the momentous effortthat went into knocking the hill down, it's a shame that nothing interestinghas been built here - though the area around Bell Street, known as<b>Belltown</b>, has some character, its tough taverns now rubbing shoulderswith upmarket caf&eacute;s with French names. This apart, the regrade isprobably best viewed from the window of the <b>monorail</b>, which runs fromthe Westlake Shopping Mall at Fifth Ave and Pine St downtown (80cents one way),crosses the area on concrete supports, and ends up inside the <b>SeattleCenter</b>.<p>	The Seattle Center is an inheritance from the 1962 World's Fair, whosetheme was "Century 21" (hence the idea of the spindly Space Needle tower, thefair's - and now Seattle's - adopted symbol). Since then the site of the fairhas become a sort of culture-park, collecting the city's symphony, ballet andopera, a couple of theaters and a museum alongside the Space Needle, and asmall amusement park.<p>	The monorail drops you close to the <b>Space Needle</b> (observation deckdaily summer 8am-midnight, winter 9am-midnight; $6). Though reminiscent of the<i>Star Trek</i> era of space-fascination, this still exudes a fair amount ofglamor, especially at night, when it's lit up and Seattle's well-to-do come toeat at its revolving restaurant. The view from the observation deck, wherethere's a (pricey) bar, is unmatched, and this is much the best place to get anoverall orientation of the city and its surroundings.<p><b>	Center House</b> is next to the terminal also, an unappetizingly darkmall-like building, and the unlikely home of the first-rate <b>SeattleChildren's Museum</b> as well as <i>The Group</i>, the city's leadingmulticultural theater group. Close by, the excellent <b>Pacific ScienceCenter</b> (summer daily 10am-6pm; rest of year Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, Sat &amp; Sun10am-6pm; $5.50), is easily recognizable by its distinctive white arches. Thisis much livelier than it sounds, full of bright, innovative and often noisyexhibits on a huge range of science-based topics, from robotic and submarinetechnology to a model of the Puget Sound area, exploring its ebbs and tides;there's a planetarium and an IMAX theater inside here too.<pre></pre><h3><a name="capitol">Capitol Hill</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>Of all Seattle's neighborhoods, <b>Capitol Hill</b>, a fifteen-minutebus-ride east of downtown, has probably raised the most eyebrows over theyears. Since young gays, hippies and assorted radicals moved in over theSixties and Seventies, this has been the city's closest thing to an alternativecenter, fulcrum of the arts scene and chancier night-time activities. In fact,the shops and caf&eacute;s around <b>Broadway</b>, the main street, are nowpretty mainstream and, despite black leather jackets slung over teenageshoulders, the neighborhood's days at the cutting edge of Seattle Bohemia areprobably over. Still, the concentration of easy-going restaurants, coffeehouses and bars provides good day-time caf&eacute;-sitting and night-timedrinking (see "Eating" and "Nightlife"), and if you're gay this is still verymuch the place to be - though homophobic violence can happen here asdisturbingly often as it does anywhere in the US.<p>	The northern end of the Capitol Hill district is, by contrast, quietlywealthy, mansions built on Gold Rush fortunes and trimmed with immaculate lawnssitting sedately around the shrubs and trees of <b>Volunteer Park</b>, named inhonor of those who volunteered for the Spanish-American War of 1898. The lovely1912 glass <b>Conservatory</b> here (daily summer 10am-7pm, winter 10am-4pm;free) packs an immediate aesthetic punch: divided into galleries simulatingdifferent climates (jungle, desert, rainforest, etc), it has a sweltering mixof perfect flowers and shrubs, and a huge collection of orchids. Also in thepark, the old <b>Water Tower</b> can be climbed for a grand (and free) panoramaacross Seattle, albeit through wire mesh.<p>	Ten blocks east of Volunteer Park, <b>Washington Park</b> stretches awayto the north, encompassing the <b>University of Washington Arboretum</b>, whoseassortment of trees shades footpaths and cycle tracks - a huge, leafyinvitation for summer walks and picnics, and especially beautiful in fall whenthe trees turn brilliant shades of red and gold. At the south end of the park,is the immaculately designed <b>Japanese Tea Gardens</b> (March-Nov daily 10amto around dusk; $1.50), a landscape of neat ornamental lakes and flower-strewnbanks.<pre></pre><h3><a name="university">The University District</a></h3></blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>Across Union Bay from the park, the <b>University District</b> (aka the "U"district) is livelier than Capitol Hill: a busy hotchpotch of coffee houses,cinemas, clothes, book and record shops, all catering to the tastes and budgetsof the University of Washington's 35,000 students. The area centers onUniversity Way, known as "<b>The Ave</b>" and lined with cheap ethnicrestaurants plus the cavernous <i>University Bookstore</i> - an excellent placeto get the lowdown on the student scene.<p>	The sprawling <b>campus</b> itself is more serene, its sedatenineteenth-century buildings and landscaped grounds overlooking Union Bay.There are a couple of museums here: the pale brick <b>Henry Art Gallery</b>, atNE 15th Ave and NE 41st St (Tues-Sun 10am-5pm, until 9pm Thurs; $3), housesAmerican and European paintings from the last two centuries, and mounts smallinnovative shows, often drawing on local work. The <b>Thomas Burke MemorialMuseum</b>, on the northwestern corner of the campus at 17th Ave and NE 45th St(daily 10am-5pm, until 10pm Thurs; $3), has carved totem poles, painted woodenmasks from the Northwest coast, plaited-fiber fans from Polynesia and sorcerycharms from New Guinea. Across Montlake Bridge, back on the other side of LakeUnion, the <b>Museum of History and Industry</b>, at 2700 24th Ave East andEast Shelby (daily 10am-5pm; $3), has a gallery reconstructing Seattle in the1880s, with homes, storefronts and a free film, though this is rather out on alimb (bus #25 from downtown drops you fairly near) - enthusiasts only.<pre></pre><h3><a name="lake">Lake Washington Canal, Ballard and other northern parts of</blockquote><!-- vox-begin --><a href="vox.htm"><img width=170 height=15 src="stuff/vox.been.there.gif" border=0 alt="vox link"></a><!-- vox-end --><blockquote>town</a></h3>The U district and Seattle's other northern neighborhoods - working west,Fremont/Wallingford, Green Lake/Greenwood and Ballard - are sliced off from therest of town by water. Lake Union, in the middle, is connected to the largerLake Washington to the east, and the sea to the west by the eight-mile-long<b>Lake Washington Ship Canal</b>. Built at the turn of the century to carryships to safe harbors on the inland lakes, the canal was used during World WarI to safeguard battleships from exposure to attack in the more open ElliottBay. If you have an hour to spare, the procession of boats passing from saltwater to fresh through a set of canal locks called the <b>Hiram M ChittendenLocks</b>, near the mouth of the canal, makes pleasant viewing (bus #17 fromdowntown), and migrating salmon bypass the locks via the <b>fish ladder</b>, asort of piscine staircase laid out with viewing windows. In peak migratingseason (late summer for salmon, fall and early winter for trout) the waterbehind the locks is full of huge, jumping fish. <p>	East of the locks is Salmon Bay, on the south side of which, beside NW15th Avenue's Ballard Bridge, is <b>Fisherman's Terminal</b>, crowded with theboats of Seattle's fishing fleet; you can buy freshly caught fish here. On thenorthern side of Salmon Bay, <b>Ballard</b> (reachable by several buses fromdowntown) was settled by Scandinavian fishermen. The <b>Nordic HeritageMuseum</b>, 3014 NW 67th St (Tues-Sat 10am-4pm, Sun noon-4pm; $3), outlinestheir history from poverty in rural Scandinavia, through immigration problemsat Ellis Island and New York tenements to arrival in the West, in a series ofrather musty tableaux in the basement of an old school. Bar a couple ofnightspots (see p.161), there's little else to see here, though if you do findyourself passing further east, along the northern shore of Lake Union, look outfor <b>Gasworks Park</b>, at N Northlake Way and Wallingford, where the rustingblack towers of an old gasworks have been left as "urban sculpture" and theslag heaps grassed over to make kite-flying mounds; on summer eveningsskateboarders bring ghetto-blasters, and their music echoes round the oldindustrial site. The park sticks out into the middle of Lake Union at the footof the <b>Fremont/Wallingford</b> district, a largely white and comparativelyprosperous neighborhood that extends north (on the west side of I-5) into thequiet residential streets of <b>Green Lake/Greenwood</b>.

All this changed when two long,floating bridges, one built in the Forties, the second in the Sixties, openedup commuting possibilities: business people poured across, tripling thepopulation of one-time rural towns <b>Bellevue</b>, <b>Kirkland</b> and<b>Redmond</b> and turning them into affluent city suburbs. Redmond became theworld headquarters of software giants Microsoft; Kirkland built plush leisurefacilities along its waterfront; and Bellevue quickly outgrew its suburbanstatus to become the state's fourth largest city with its own smart businessdistrict and shopping area, the showpiece of which is the expensively stocked<b>Bellevue Square Mall</b>. Malls and lake views aside, these three towns havelittle to recommend them, though neighboring <b>Mercer Island</b>, in themiddle of Lake Washington, is a pleasant, leafy interlude just a few minutes'drive from downtown along I-90. <pre></pre><!-- upto-begin --><h5><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/roughindex.htm">Go Up a Level</a></h5><!-- upto-end --><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/rough/city.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href="../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &copy; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
