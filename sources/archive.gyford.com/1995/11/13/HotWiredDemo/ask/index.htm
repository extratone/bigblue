(Most of the boys <i>I</i> knowcertainly do.) So let's spend a few paragraphs addressing the issue, shall we?<p> Now boys, I'm going to give you a tip here today, and if you want to go to <ahref="http://alive.mcn.org/angelnet.html/">heaven</a> when you die, you'll payattention.  When you take a woman, girl, or whomever on a <ahref="http://www.jjplaza.com/singles/">date</a>, you need to follow a fewrules of dating protocol.<img align=left src="stuff/phonefr.gif">  Most important, the post-date phone call.  Thisapplies even when you've had a fairly unremarkable time and is <i>especially</i>important if you've had an extremely <a href="http://www.ag.com/Condom/Country">eventful</a> time, if you know what I mean (and I think you do). You can alwayscall and leave a message when you know she isn't home; she'll understand. Butthe call <i>must</i> be made. <p> You may be saying, but Allison, Why does theboy have to make the call? What about the woman? Women can be just as insensitiveas men, can't they?  And yes, you are correct, but that's the very reason youneed to use care in these situations.  You know what they say about a womanscorned, don't you?  Besides, most women I know are intelligent enough to makethe call without being told. </h3><pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison,<br> I am looking for AlcoholicsAnonymous on the Web. Do you know where to find it? <br> <b>Signed, Anonymous </b><p> <imgsrc="stuff/answer.gif"> AA is allover the Web, it seems, and with the drinking Isee these Internet folks doing, it's a damn good thing. You can find the <ahref="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~clyde/BillW/BB_Introduction.html">Big Book</a> ofAA,  <a href="http://www.crl.com/~pac/aa/">online meetings</a>, and <ahref="http://www.moscow.com/Resources/SelfHelp/AA/">unofficial</a> AA pagesgalore.  If you don't like those, try the aptly named <ahref="http://www.well.com/user/woa/">Web of Addictions</a>.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison,<br> What do you think about eroticfilm? Don't you think that is unmoral human being? Why some government providedthe law for that stink film? <br> <b>Signed, Hymicky </b><p> <img src="stuff/answer.gif"> Well,first off, let me answer with another question: What's up with your grammar andwriting style?  Were you not taught as a child the <ahref="http://hera.life.uiuc.edu/rock.html">fundamentals</a> of the Englishlanguage?  What would a <a href="http://www.dnai.com/~children/>child</a> thinkof such poor command of the language, from a seemingly grown-up person? Now, <ahref="http://www.xmission.com/~legalize/asm/asm.html">erotic film</a> and <ahref="http://www.realm.net/~brandy/home.html">erotic acting</a>, on the otherhand, are often considered art forms, protected by the FirstAmendment of the US Constitution as types of free speech.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison, <br> Is it considered rude to bringfood from one eatery into  another as long as you buy something from the one towhich you brought the outside food? For example, I like to get my breakfastmuffins from Cafe A, but buy juice from and eat my breakfast at Cafe B. <br> <b>Signed, DC</b><p><img align=right src="stuff/tobtiny.gif"> <img src="stuff/answer.gif"> Is this the question that keeps you awake atnight? If it is, my friend, you do have a problem, which has nothing to do withyour <a href="http://www.flightpath.com/Brento/InternetCafes.HTML">cafe ofchoice</a>.  Have you asked the owners of the establishments your question? Havethey ever asked you to leave? Looked at you rudely?  Pointed at you and laughed? Thrown <a href="http://www.preferred.com/~joey/insult.html">insults</a> at you? Ifnot, don't let it get to you.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison,<br> I live in a small apartmentbuilding, and my roommate and I are quite vocal with our intimacy. I am temptedto ask my neighbors if they can hear us. Is there a tasteful way of doing that?<br> <b>Signed, Wondering</b><p> <img src="stuff/answer.gif"> No, there isn't.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison,<br> How did you make that <i>darling</i>wallpaper? <br> <b>Signed, Pointless in Petersberg </b><p> <img src="stuff/answer.gif"> Oh, I'mso glad you like the wallpaper.  How kind of you to mention it.  Someday I hopeall browsers will let their users see all the lovely wallpaper on theInternet, but alas, until that day, you can count yourself among the lucky ones.You do it by simply manipulating your &lt;body&gt; tags and by <i>not</i> using thosenasty <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape-only</a> tags.  You can find outall about it <ahref="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Backgrounds/">here</a>.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/question.gif"> Dear Allison,<br> You sound <i>just</i> like someone whoused to write a similar column here in the Triangle Area of North Carolina, onlyher name was Esther.
