Over the phone from New York, Bozulich speaks withreverence of the punk priestess, whom she'll soon see perform in Central Park.<p>"The mid-to-late '70s were all about <ahref="index.htm">Black Sabbath</a> and TedNugent and stuff like that for me," Bozulich says. "Then I saw Patti Smith on<i>Don Kirshner's Rock Concert</i>. That changed my life."<p><img align=right src="stuff/eek.girl.gif" height=429 width=164>Smith'sinfluence on the Fibbers is obvious to those who have seen the Los Angeles-basedband in concert or heard its debut album, <i>Lost Between the Earth and MyHome</i>. The Fibbers certainly don't sound like Smith - their music has a morerustic feel - but Bozulich shares Smith's intensity and artistic ambition.<p>Not far from where Smith will perform, there's another New York stage thatmeans a lot to Bozulich: "My biggest aspiration in life is to go to the Met andsee <i>La Traviatta</i> or something," Bozulich says, "That would be it for me."<p>That might come as a surprise to some, but Bozulich's move toward theAppalachian country music that influences the Fibbers probably shocked fans ofher previous band - the brutal and industrial trio, Ethyl Meatplow.<p>"I don't know how to make this a clever quote," Bozulich says with the shynessthat marks her speech but never her music, "but I think of life as a big saladbar - an amazing salad bar - so big that you can't imagine how many things thereare. And I want to taste it all."<p><img align=left src="stuff/w.gif" alt=""W" height=132 width=181>anting to bethe girl with the most salad, so to speak, is important to Bozulich's music aswell as her musical taste. On <i>Lost Between the Earth and My Home</I>, Bozulichmoves through a vast array of female characters, projecting down-and-out despairon "<a href="https://archive.gyford.com/soundz/95/41/feature/crap/lilybelle.aiff">Lilybelle</a>" [282k .aiff] ("In the dark sheis rocking/Not to records but to voices in her head"); unhinged nihilism on "<ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/soundz/95/41/feature/crap/dragon.aiff">Dragon Lady</a>" [225k .aiff] ("I'm stoppingeverything/Making fun of myself/Drinking lipstick/Tipping bookshelves/Ripping upwords that I thought were important"); and see-ya-later bravado on "<ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/soundz/95/41/feature/crap/dusted.aiff">Dusted</a>" [287k .aiff] ("I'd like to curl you up with abetter book/But there's no finer fish to hook/And I'm gone gone gone gone/I'mdusted").<p>Bozulich says all these characters are her, though. "When I started writingreally seriously for this band I really started writing the record that kind ofsummed up my life to date," she says. "This record is really me."<p>Bozulich <i>has</i> had a varied life. Born and raised in San Pedro - thesame Los Angeles harbor community that spawned the Minutemen - Bozulich waskicked out of her house at 16 by her mother and stepfather. She workedminimum-wage retail jobs, eventually finding work as a live-in housekeeper forElla Fitzgerald's pianist.<p>"I don't really want to get into the whole sob story thing with people, so Itend to shy away from being too specific with what the songs are about," shesays. "But it's safe to say I tend to draw from reality rather than hypotheticalsituations."<p align=center><img src="stuff/mike.gif" height=218 width=333><p>Many of the songs of <i>Lost Between</i> have an eerie desperation, but thingsare better now for Bozulich, who is close with Fibbers Daniel Keenan (leadguitar), Kevin Fitzgerald (drums), and William Tutton (acoustic bass). "Daniel'smy best friend, Kevin is a dear friend, and so is Bill. The only person who isjust sort of joining the family is Jessy Green, the violin player, who we foundby calling McCabe's [music store] and asking if they could recommend someone."<p>Bozulich and her friends formed the Fibbers just as it seemed Ethyl Meatplowwas on the verge of big things, and Keenan, Fitzgerald, and Tutton were alsoinvolved in other bands. "We were doing it just for fun," Bozulich says, and atfirst the band played covers of such country minidramas as George Jones's "TheGrand Tour," Dolly Parton's "Jolene," and Bobbie Gentry's white-trash-but-proudanthem, "Fancy."<p>When Ethyl Meatplow's record company crumbled last year and the band itselfdid the same, Bozulich got serious about the Fibbers.<p>"I started to think of music as a career when Ethyl Meatplow started touring10 months out of the year," she says. "People would say, What do you want to dowhen you grow up? I would make something up to answer, but in my head I'd think,I'm not going to grow up. I'm gonna be dead first. But when I got honest aboutit, I knew I wanted to work with art ... I always had this voice saying, Youdon't have a chance at that. But at the same time I had this other voice saying,That's the only thing you could be doing. I feel very lucky, because it workeditself out."<p  align=center><img src="stuff/bed.gif" height=66 width=114><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">30 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">51 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
