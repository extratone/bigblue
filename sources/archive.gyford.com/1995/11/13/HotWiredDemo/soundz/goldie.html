Artist/producer Goldie may change that with<i>Timeless</i>, his major-label debut.<p>Luckily, Goldie is the best possible link between the general public andEngland's Jungle underground scene. Steering away from what might be called thelook-what-a-big-studio-I-have approach, he ventures into the realm of ambientjungle, combining raw polyrhythms and bizare wave forms with lush arrangements.His music retains its underground feel, but listeners can tune into its layeredcomplexity.<p>One of Jungle's characteristics is the high-speed break beat, which usesdigitally "chopped" samples to deliver otherworldly grooves. Goldie's skill inthis area is showcased on "<a href="stuff/saint.aiff"> Angel</a>" [241k.aiff], which harkens back to when Jungle's synth melodies were every bit asimportant as its beats. "<a href="stuff/saint.aiff">Sea of tears</a>" [249k.aiff] flows in the other direction; Goldie throws jazz guitar into the mix,perhaps to compensate for any misconceptions a listener might have.<p>It might be a good idea to turn the bass down a few notches before playing "<a href="stuff/saint.aiff">Kemistry</a>" [267k .aiff]. The song's bass linesrumble along at about half of the percussion's 160 beats-per-minute. Mercifully,Goldie reins in the track's hyperactivity with breathy female vocals fragmentsand warm strings, but the song's staccato rhythms still play tricks on one'sears.<p>In terms of accessibility, Jungle music can live up to its name all tooeasily. It would be overwhelming to the uninitiated were it not for artists likeGoldie, who fits enough sonic information on <i>Timeless</i> to make it a greatintroduction to an exciting, quickly evolving new genre of music.<p>By <a href="stuff/saint.aiff">Dan Sicko</a></dl></dl></dl></dd><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="stuff/saint.aiff"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><br><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/soundz/footer/mainbar_nonmember1.map"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><br></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A href="../threads/index.htm">27 topics</A>, <A href="../threads/index.htm">47 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "https://archive.gyford.com/full.copyright.html">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
