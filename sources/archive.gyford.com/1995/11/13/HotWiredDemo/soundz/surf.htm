Instead of heading out tothe so-called mistake by the lake for your information onaging rock stars, why not visit the online home of the <ahref="index.htm">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame andMuseum</a>? Just don't ask where the Velvet Underground is.<pre></pre><img align=right src="stuff/pluse.gif">Looking to explore underground dance music on CD-plus?You can't do it on the Web, but you can get a <ahref="index.htm">tantalizing look</a> at the<i>head-travel</i> CD-plus. This eye-catching site offers alook (well, a listen, actually) at some of the electronicmusic artists whose work is on the CD-plus.<p><img align=left src="stuff/groove.gif"><pre></pre>Want to be a DJ or just act like one? The easiest way tostay on top of the quickly changing sounds of house music isto sample before you buy at the <ahref="index.htm">Rare GrooveSong Snippets</a> site.

OK, now go and check out <ahref="index.htm">LiSTeN UpMAGaZINE</a>, a "real-time" music magazine that usesRealAudio technology to prove that new media doesn't have tosound good.
