Just don't spraypaint the walls.<p><img align=left src="stuff/subhead.gif" alt="Where coffee grounds meet holy ground, online" width=200 height=41>The CyberNet Caf&eacute; throws a very different spin on the nowfamiliar Internet <ahref="ccafe.htm">caf&eacute;</a>genre: here they serve up Christian salvation with theircappuccinos. Soothing canned music praises Jesus Christ,while over on the reference shelf, alongside back issues of<cite>Internet World</cite> and <cite><ahref="../wired/index.htm">Wired</a></cite>, aretracts such as "A Nation Under God" and "The Passion andDeath of Our Lord Jesus."<p><img align=left src="stuff/cybercafe.gif" width=200 height=141>"We want to use this as a place of witness," says <ahref="mailto:allen@cybertrek.com.sg">Allen Lok Fun Luen</a>,one of four Christian college friends who founded CyberNet."Whenever the door is open, we can share the good news."<p>Twelve Acer 486 PC clones run Netscape and Quarterdeckbrowsers on a 64,000-bps leased line. The clean, well-litcaf&eacute; is essentially split down the middle with terminals onone side and gingham cloth-covered tables and chairs on theother, where patrons sip tea and play chess. Just keep yourcurry puffs, espressos, and Nasi Lemak (a dish of rice,chicken, sardines, egg, and chili peppers) away from thekeyboards - Singapore's Ministry of Environment has bannedcomputers and food from sharing the same tables, citinghygienic reasons.<p>In <ahref="gibson.htm">Singapore</a>,traditional Christian values are revered as much asfuturistic visions, and <ahref="tech.htm">technology</a> is valued for itsbusiness - and spiritual - potential. Most patrons arestudents, teachers, and young working adults, but the shopalso attracts its share of pilgrims. Christian missionariesfrom <ahref="malaysia.htm">Malaysia</a>,<a href="indonesa.htm">Indonesia</a>,and the United States, who've heard about the caf&eacute; throughword-of-mouth and newspaper ads, often drop in to send emailgreetings to their churches back home. The caf&eacute;'s attendantsare more than eager to help them find <ahref="gospl.htm">Christian</a> Web sites.<p>The downloading of images from <ahref="news:alt.binaries.pictures.erotica">alt.binaries.pictures.erotica</a>,however, is not recommended.</h3></dl></blockquote><pre><a href="headed.htm"><b>H e a d e d   t o   t h e   C y b e r N e t  C a f &eacute;?</b></a></pre><dl><dd><blockquote><b>Story and photograph by <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/People/Bios/chang.h/">Helen Chang</a></b></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><!-- channeldir not set --><p><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="https://archive.gyford.com/cgi-bin/interact/threads?dispatch">2 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">1 link</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/dispatch/95/43/index5a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
