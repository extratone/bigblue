Although bothcreatures' popularity has been proven by parodies on <i>The Simpsons</i>, many ofChaney's bizarre characters, and black-and-white immortals<img  align=rightsrc="stuff/ug.mo.gif"> such as <i>Vampyr</i>,and <i>She ... Who Must Be Obeyed</i> have yet to be seen in midnight movies orcult videos.<p>These lesser-known horrors have been rotting in vaults, while the classicnightmares of the silent era were painfully represented by damaged, blearyflickers, but now, just in time for Halloween, Kino Video has released acatalog of seminal horror films and almost-forgotten episodes of the uncanny,all digitally remastered and restored to their original glory.<p><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> is the centerpiece of the collection, and isnot only a powerful, eerie, and twisted tragedy, but also proof that everythingyou know about silent movies is wrong. Silent film is an art form known mostlyfrom low-quality clips shown at the wrong speed and to skating-rink organ music.Flickering, badly scored snippets are poor examples.<pre></pre><dl><dl><dl><dd><p>Horror<p><a href="b.html">The Phantom</a><p><a href="c.html">Outside the Law</a><p><a href="d.html">She ...</a></h3></dl></dl></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/ren2.0/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/kino/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="a.html"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">16 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">25 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
