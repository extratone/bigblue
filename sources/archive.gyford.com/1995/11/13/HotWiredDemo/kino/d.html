Who Must Be Obeyed!</i> stars cowboy heartthrob Randolf Scott as anadventurer, and this '30s adventure classic is the sort of lavish, bizarre, ...well, let's just say that Steven Spielberg was profoundly influenced by flickslike this. Merian C. Cooper produced this movie, hoping to make more money fromthe same folks who saw his <i>King Kong</i>, in fact some of the gates in thisArctic adventure look like set pieces from <i>Kong</i>. The plot makes no senseat all - explorers on a quest for the fountain of youth find a mad queen hidingunder a polar ice cap - and it doesn't matter. The huge sets of the palace, thepalace of "she ... who must be obeyed," are vast, glossy, deco masterpieces. Theice-bound adventures in this new, crisp clean print, are stunning - the avalanchescene in <i>She</i> makes the ice cave of <i>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</i> looklike something from a <i>Chilly Willy</i> cartoon.<p>The Kino Month of Horror series has films, like <i>Phantom</i> and<i>Nosferatu</i>, that should be seen because they are works of genius, period.The series also offers a wealth of rarely seen and long-lost movie history, andhorror and film fans who expect to be taken seriously had better take a look.<pre></pre><p><a href="a.html">Horror</a><p><a href="b.html">The Phantom</a><p><a href="c.html">Outside the Law</a><p>She ...</h3><pre> </pre><h3><p>Kino Video<br></h3>333 West 39th Street, Suite 503<br>New York, NY 10018<br>Phone +1 (212) 629 6880<br>Fax +1 (212) 714 0871<br>Email: <a href="mailto:kinoint@infohouse.com">kinoint@infohouse.com</a><br>All films $29.95 retail<pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../ren2.0/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="d.html"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">16 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">25 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
