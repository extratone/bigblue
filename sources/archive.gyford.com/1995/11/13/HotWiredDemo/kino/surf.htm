The memorable "freshmaker" <ahref="index.htm">Mentos</a> commercials have finallybeen given their rightful tribute on the Web. This site is a sugary gem - withsurprisingly analytical discussions of television advertising. The Mentos FAQprovides complete synopses of all seven Mentos commercials - from the often-aired("The Car Movers" and "The Broken Shoe") to the obscure and rarely seen ("The 3Second Car Jacking"). Unfortunately, the FAQ authors failed to include anyQuickTime clips of the commercials, but you can re-"fresh" your memory with thecomplete jingle lyrics and in-depth background on product packaging, ingredients,and nutritional value (if any). Mmmmm ... it's the freshmaaakerr!<pre></pre>Celestial department stores, space hippies, and talking carrots are only a few ofthe details you'll pick up reading the synopses of television's B-great, <ahref="index.htm"><i>Lost In Space</i></a><img align=right src="stuff/lost.gif"> (1965-68). Unfortunately, you won't find any glitzy pics of Dr. Zachary Smith,the Robinsons, or purple Styrofoam alien mountainscapes. But the site doesprovide a complete episode guide, including air dates, directors, writers, and -best of all - a chronological listing of episode titles, such as "Anti-MatterMan"(1967), "The Space Primevals" (1967), and "The Android Machine" (1966).<p><img align=left src="stuff/molecule.gif"><pre></pre>But if science fiction leaves your mind rattling into space, you might need toincrease your oxygen intake. Try a new fix: some real hard-core <ahref="index.htm">molecularanimation</a>. Dig chemistry for art's sake, and take a trip down molecule mile.You won't be disappointed by "The C60 Buckminster fullerene structure," one ofmany technicolor mpeg films designed not only to help the viewer "visualize"molecular structure, but to please the jaded cornea as well. You won't be tested.<pre></pre>Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you didn't want to believe it was true ... but itis. Pull your head out of the sand and face the crass glory of it all. The Webbrings you <a href="index.htm">Autographs ofFamous Movie, Pop, and T.V. Stars</a>. Yes, a touch of Hollywood class is at the<img align=left src="stuff/autograph.gif">tips of your fingers, just a keystroke away. Alan Alda's sig is only US$125 andcomes framed with a "lovely photo." Richard Burton, gone but not forgotten, isUS$420. Or pick from the "famous woman" category: Brigitte Bardot for US$185 orthe bargain-priced Liza Minelli at US$155. Oh, why not go for broke? Get a "set" at two-for-one: Abbott and Costello for $320 or Linda Gray and Larry Hagman -together always and forever - for US$185. The order form is simple, just allowfor shipping and handling - these starlets are coming all the way from Australia!<p>By <a href="mailto:sarah@hotwired.com">Monkeybird</a><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../ren2.0/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/kino/index.html"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">16 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">25 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
