And it's not justbecause I'd miss a day.  Like the industrial magnates who spew wasteinto open water and insist that it will all "wash out to sea," I'mwaist-deep in denial. I have a hard time admitting to myself howpathetically degraded many of my own favorite spots on the coast havebecome.<p>Recently, environmental groups, including <ahref="index.htm">Surfrider Foundation</a> and the<a href="index.htm">Sierra Club</a>, have had toresort to litigation to force governments to even consider moreefficient sewage treatment.  At the Sloughs, this means that thepowers-that-be are pondering the creation of giant ponds where thefouled runoff of the Tijuana River can be cleaned and recycled.<p>I'll believe it when I see it - or smell it. When I surf, I knowthe risks. I accept that I may have to get a few stitches or swallow afew mouthfuls of brine, and that's a price I'm willing to pay.<p>After a day of wallowing in the Sloughs - peeling off my suit andnoticing again how it stinks - I think about the "Bambi Syndrome."Zoologists explain that degradation of habitats kills off wholeecosystems if the species at home in them aren't cute enough to drawthe necessary publicity required to "save" them.  Is there anythingswimming in the Sloughs cute enough to inspire a worldwide movement toclean up the Tijuana River?<br><p>Story by <a href="index.htm">Matt Margolin</a></table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">2 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">5 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/copyrigh.html">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
