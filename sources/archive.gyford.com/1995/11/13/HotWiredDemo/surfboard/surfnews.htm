Though the first swells of the season whippedup sizeable surf in California in late September, scientists warn not to expectanother epic winter.<p>Two swells from the Southern Hemisphere combined to generate conditions up toa few feet overhead for Southern California, but the real goods came down fromthe Aleutian Islands, where an unusual tropical storm produced 8- to 12-foot surfin Central California, and pounded the northern part of the state withdouble-overhead-plus conditions.<p>"This winter will be more in the normal range for swell activity," advisesmeteorologist Sean Collins. "There's no El Ni&#241;o this year, or combination ofhigh pressure systems and storm tracks that made last winter so good." Since a"normal" California winter includes long periods of west-wind slop and lake-likeconditions, you'd better enjoy it while you can.<p>Story by Keith Hunter<br><pre><p><p></pre><td><tr><td ><td><h4>No more 1-900 Lines - <br>Surf Reports go Digital</h4><tr><td><td valign=left colspan=2>Tired of hanging on the phone through hours of surf-shop specials, only to betold that the swells are knee-high to a Malibu Ken doll? QuickLook Internationalrecently put up kiosks in Hawaii and Florida, providing the surf community'sfirst remotely-accessed video surf reports. Somebody swiped the first cameraright off the beach, but Quicklook's got bigger problems - namely that it takestheir rig 10 minutes to transfer 30 seconds of surf from shore to kiosk.<p>For US$2, you can view a series of clips spanning 4 hours of surf. Don'tfeel like driving down to the kiosk either? QuickLook is currently hunting fora Net provider.<p>Story by Amy Vansant</table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview"></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">2 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">5 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
