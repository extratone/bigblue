Midlevel policy makers and agents - those who havedone the heavy lifting on the case - actually balked at the idea of widespreaddistribution of the bomber's diatribe.<p>Citing US policy that prohibits negotiation with terrorists, those whoopposed the publication said the act of lobbying the newspapers for publicationwas tantamount to "negotiations," according to Department of Justice sources.<p>Inside the FBI, publication was strongly opposed by members of the FBI'sspecial Unabomber task force, sources said. Only Freeh and a few of his toplevel sidekicks sought publication, according to FBI sources. Members of thetask force weren't - and still aren't - convinced that publication would breakany new leads. "In fact, it might just create more havoc," said one FBI agent. That same trepidation also explains why the manuscript didn't make it onto theNet earlier.<p>But FBI sources said Freeh was desperate for some "movement, for some goodpress." At the time of publication, the FBI director was taking heat from acongressional investigation into the botched assault on the <ahref="index.htm">Branch Davidian</a> complexin Waco and the fatal shootings of innocents during the <ahref="index.htm">Ruby Ridge</a> incident.<h3>Telecom Bill Rigged for Indecency</h3><p>As Muckraker <ahref="index.htm">previouslyreported</a>, rumors surrounding the death of the infamous Exon amendment havebeen greatly exaggerated. On 25 October, the House and Senate choose up sides,sending 45 members of both houses to a "conference committee" charged withhammering out the differences between two versions of the telecom reform bill.The single bill that emerges will then be sent to <ahref="index.htm">President Clinton</a>. At that point, he caneither sign it into law or veto it (which he has threatened to do).<p>The Senate version of the bill contains the <ahref="index.htm">Exonamendment</a>, which imposes strict indecency standards on speech in cyberspace,punishable by  fines of up to US$100,000 and jail time of up to two years foranyone transmitting "indecent" speech in cyberspace.<p>The House version contains the <ahref="index.htm">Cox/Wyden amendment</a>, whichemphasizes the use of technology to help "empower" parents, giving them tools tohelp keep indecent speech out of the hands of minors. It doesn't, however, putany kind of indecency limits on cyberspeech.<p>However, the House bill also includes an indecency clause for cyberspacespeech. This language was slipped in among a host of other amendments at thelast minute, forcing Congress to vote either up or down on the whole package. The entire package passed, including the indecency language.<p>Because the Cox-Wyden bill passed so overwhelmingly, many believed that itwould virtually sweep the Exon amendment under the table in the conferencecommittee.  One small problem: the deck has been stacked in favor of Exon.<p>First, the committee plans to use the Senate version of the bill as the mainworking model, which gives Senate language an automatic leg up. Second, SenatorJames Exon (D-Nebraska) himself is a member of the conference committee. All theSenators on the committee voted for the Exon amendment;  none of the bill'sdetractors, on the Senate side, will have any say during the conference. One ofthe cyberspace's most vocal advocates, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) got shutout of the conference process.<p>On the House side, neither Representative Chris Cox (R-California) norRepresentative Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) are members of the conference committee!However, the third and often forgotten co-sponsor of the bill, RepresentativeRick White (R-Washington) did make the cut. White told me that he plans to makesure "cybercom" issues don't get a short shrift during the conference and that he"absolutely" plans on playing a role in defending the Cox-Wyden bill. Thefreshman congressman, however, is seen mostly as a lightweight legislator.<p>On the positive side, it appears that Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) willbe closely participating in the conference, though not a member himself. Gingrichis on record saying the Exon amendment is "probably unconstitutional." Also,Representatives Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Jack Fields (D-Texas), who alsois chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee, are on the conference committeeand each spoke in favor of the Cox-Wyden amendment during debate on the bill.<p>Prognosis: a toss up. All the conferees want to get the bill out ofcommittee by Thanksgiving. To do that, they have to deal with severalcontentious issues. If the indecency issue is left to the end, the lawmakers maynot have a lot of fight in them and the deal could go either way.<h3>ACLU Seeks Net Sex Writer</h3><p>In anticipation of the worst case scenario - that the Exon amendment languagebecomes law - the first ever cyberspace protest movement is being planned.<p>The <a href="index.htm">American CivilLiberties Union</a> is already lining up potential plaintiffs to challenge theamendment's language. These folks would be willing to subject themselvesto litigation by willingly violating the new indecency laws. The ACLU, of course,picks up the tab, you get lots of ink, a possible trip to the US Supreme Court, andhopefully, no jail time.<p>The ACLU's <a href=mailto:beeson@aclu.org>Ann Beeson</a> said theorganization is looking for plaintiffs who "use online networks to discuss ordistribute works or art, literary classics, sex education, gay and lesbianliterature, human rights reporting, abortion information, rape counseling,controversial political speech, or any other material that could be deemed"indecent" and therefore illegal under the proposed law."<p>Groups that have already volunteered include academicresearchers of human sexuality, distributors of gay andlesbian resources, student groups with controversial Webpages, human rights groups, and prisoners' rights groups. TheACLU itself will be a plaintiff, because of its<i>Constitution Hall</i> space on American Online. The ACLUmaintains a bulletin board on the site titled"Masturbation," which sprang up when Jocelyn Elders wasfired but has since taken on a life of its own.<p>The ACLU is still looking for a few good plaintiffs tojoin the fight. If the conference committee gets twisted andactually allows this fucked up Exon language to stand, thenext few years could make DC - not to mention the Net - areal war zone.<p>Somehow I doubt we'll have to draft any ground troops.<p>Meeks out....<br><img src="stuff/sig.red.gif"></dl></dl></dl></dl><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/signal/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">25 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">11 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/muckraker/95/44/index2a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
