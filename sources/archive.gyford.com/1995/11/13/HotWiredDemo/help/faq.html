Instead, it's a new medium demanding newthinking, new content.<p>Today's events mirror television's arrival as a mass medium in 1948. Globalnetworks are connecting people with captivating words, pictures, sounds, andideas from around the world. Online communities are beginning to find theirvoice. Passive entertainment is pass&eacute;. Through interactivity, people donot talk back to machines - they  <i>connect</i> to one another.<p>We're building something rich and strange. Full of discussion, dialog,commentary, art, sound, and vision. Help us define the future of this newmedium.<a name="2"><h3>Does HotWired cost anything?</h3></a><p>No. HotWired is free. But you do need a live TCP/IP Internetconnection to visit HotWired. If you don't know how to do this, wehave a series of free articles called "Getting Wired." To retrievethis file via basic Internet email, send a message to:<p><a href="index.htm">info-rama@hotwired.com</a> with the words<p><blockquote> send getting.wired</blockquote><p>in the body of the message.<p>This will hopefully give you a place to start.<p>You also need a compatible Web browser to access HotWired. Please read our pageof recommended  <a href="index.htm">browsers</a>.<a name="3"><h3>What can I do with my member name and password</h3></a>    <p>Your member name will allow you to be recognized by other HotWired users in <a href="index.htm">Club Wired</a> if you should join achat session, and it will be your signature when you post a message in the<a href="index.htm">Threads</a> section.  It gives you a unique identity on HotWired. <p>Aside from verifying your identity, registration information allows usto offer each user a customized online environment.  For example,HotWired generates a "<a href="index.htm">What's new</a>"page for each user that lists all of the content that the user hasn'tyet seen. Your registration also allows us to tell our <a href="index.htm">sponsors</a>exactly how many people have seen their banners.  Providing oursponsors with this information allows us to make HotWired available toyou, free of charge. Without sponsorship we could not do that. <a name="4"><h3>How do I contact a human at HotWired? </h3></a><p>If you are having trouble with HotWired, please see the <a href="index.htm">Need Help</a> page, for information on how to contact the support team.<p>If you think you've found a bug while using HotWired, please send adescription of the problem, along with the type and version of the Webbrowser you're using, and the type of computer you're using, to <a href="index.htm">bugs</a>.
