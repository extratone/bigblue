These levels have never been seenbefore, even by guides who have been working on the river for morethan a decade. Some of the rapids are becoming particularly nasty,with talk among the managers and senior guides that this will lead tonew runs and possible portages. Shearwater, <ahref="index.htm">Sobek</A>, andFrontiers have stopped running paddle boats on the top section (rapid1 to 10); however, Safari Par Excellence and Raft Extreme arecontinuing to do so, as both companies believe their guides areskilled and experienced enough to keep their boats in the water.<p> Rapids 5 and 7 are the two on the top section causing the mostproblems at present. Rapid 5 has become very shallow, and the TenKwacha Tightrope (a Kwacha is a unit of <ahref="index.htm">Zambian</A>currency), which is the favored run between the pourover (river right)and the Catcher's Mitt (river left), are becoming narrower daily. Apourover run will definitely end in tears, and anyone running therecould end up with some pretty nasty injuries.<p>Story by <a href="index.htm">"Muzza"Trail</a> <BR>Video courtesy of <a href="index.htm">Scott Kazmar</a><BR><BR><BR><tr><td valign=top><img src="stuff/sce_logo.gif"><td colspan=2><h4>Kern's<br>New Cataracts</h4><tr> <td> <td colspan=2><ahref="index.htm">Southern CaliforniaEdison</a> is conducting a flow study that could improve boating onthe previously closed cataracts of the Kern River. Edison divertswater from the Kern to a nearby power plant, and then releases it backinto the river. The study will determine the minimum and optimum flowsfor different kinds of boating, as well as evaluate how those levelswould affect fish and wildlife. Rapids on the stretch of river varybetween Class III and Class V. Study results should be available nextspring, so be ready.<p>Story by <a href="mailto:kristinw@hotwired.com">Kristin Windbigler</a><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><tr><td ><td colspan=2><h4>Tullyho!<br>Another World Title!</h4><tr> <td> <td>If your team didn't take first at the <ahref="index.htm">Camel InternationalWhitewater Challenge</a> in Africa, be patient. There will soon bemore than enough world titles to go around. Yet another world-classrace is scheduled for next year in Australia, and the Aussies aretouting theirs as the <i>real</i> whitewater championship.<p>Australia will host the World Whitewater Challenge on the TullyRiver in northern <ahref="index.htm">Queensland</A> inNovember of '96. The Tully is a low-volume technical river, whichmakes mass starts impossible, and the race less exciting forspectators.<p>Until a universal governing body is formed for whitewater rafting,we may never know who are truly the greatest boaters of all.<p> Story by <a href="mailto:kristinw@hotwired.com">Kristin Windbigler</a><BR><BR><BR> <tr></table><BR><BR><BR><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">1 topic</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">5 links</A>.</H4><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/adrenaline/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/rapid/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/cgi-bin/users/imagemap/rapid/footer/mainbar_member.map"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
