Mike, we're in deep to you, buddy.<p>Even if you don't know Mike, you might know his phone number. Morethan 200 people a day have started to check river conditions with <ahref="mailto:kflow@netlink.net">K-Flow</a>. Most of the river-flowdata in Adrenaline comes from K-Flow, a <i>free</i> phone and fax-backservice that will give you flow data on every river in California.  Ifyou didn't check with Mike, your kayak is probably scraping or youdidn't realize that some dam gate in another county would open thenight before your trip.<p>K-Flow, which Mike says is either named after himself ornamed to sound like a radio station, started three wintersago, when he began analyzing groundwater level data aspart of his day job as an environmental technician for theCalifornia Data Exchange Center.<p>When the the center got tired of sifting through data for him,it gave him full access to its computer bank. It was themotherlode of river intelligence. "I began to use the dataand give it to my friends," says Koza, "and pretty soon, Iwas spending all my time on the phone."<p>So, the first glimpse of the future of boating came inthe guise of an answering machine and a six-minute messagethat "sort of irritated some of the less-than-patient."<p>But when Ney Grant, a professional fax analystand fellow boater, offered to bring over fancy fax-backequipment, K-Flow started to gain serious audience share.The service, which is partially sponsored by WhitewaterVoyages, Pacific River Supply, Chico Canoe and Kayak, CustomKayak Interiors, and OARS, Inc., barely breaks even and Kozapays phone bills as high as $900 a month.  "I haven'tfigured a way to make money off of it, but then again Icouldn't figure out how to make a living off being aprofessional river guide either."<p> Koza, who is a strictly inflatable kayak-and-raft kindof guy, has spent just about every weekend on a differentriver for the past decade. "I go down rivers that I don'tever see anyone on. I put them on K-Flow, hoping people willcatch on," he says, with a bit of skepticism in his voice.<p>Mike collects the data from a variety of sources, including computers,phone calls to state agencies, and reading voluminous governmenttomes during his lunch hour. Since the data from theriver gauges (which frequently break and go unrepaired) areoften wrong, Mike extrapolates from previous data to give anestimate. "I've seen the state report the same flow for theSalmon for like three weeks in row, which is ridiculous."<p> Mike, I'm coming over - six-pack in hand. <p>Story by Seth Kaplan</table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">1 topic</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">5 links</A>.</H4><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/adren/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/cgi-bin/users/imagemap/rapid/footer/mainbar_member.map"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
