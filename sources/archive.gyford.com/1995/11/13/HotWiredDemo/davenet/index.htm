He's got a bit of heat. I hope he doessomething good with it." I was referring to the connectionbetween the <a href="index.htm">NeXT</a> operatingsystem and the Web. I was surprised at the time to findout that NeXT users were instrumental in building theprotocols, tools, and servers of the Web (in fact, the Webwas <a href="index.htm">created</a>on a NeXT). It seemed that Jobs could do something with thatheat.<p>And he has: <a href="index.htm">WebObjects</a>,"An environment for rapidly building and deploying Web-basedapplications on top of many popular operating systems,including Windows NT, Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, and others."<p>Jobs is pushing for interactive Web sites. Yeah. Steve,man, you got it!<h2><pre>How Apple Became Cuba</h2></pre><p><a href="mailto:steven@well.com">Steven Levy</a> has agreat column in the 21 August 1995 issue of <cite>Newsweek</cite>. <a href="index.htm">Apple</a> management is tryingto spin <a href="index.htm">Windows 95</a>as an opportunity for growth of the Macintosh platform. Levytakes his best shot: "Are they kidding? Windows 95 is not anApple opportunity; it's a nuclear-tipped Scud lofted towardCupertino."<p>The title of Levy's piece, "How Apple Became Avis," istoo generous. It should be "How Apple Became Cuba."<p>"The company might one day be known as the mostsuccessful niche player of all," Levy writes. "But it couldhave been much, much more."<p>Sounds like Cuba! The most successful niche player of alltime - but look where it got them....<p>Business as usual is a prescription for devastation atApple.<p>Creative thinking and bold action are the order of theday: Trust the universe. Take a chance now.<p>Apple shareholders: there's no time to waste.<p>The missiles are in the air!<h2><pre>Apple Is a Lousy Lover</h2></pre><p>It's becoming harder and harder to be a Macintoshdeveloper.<p>I started writing about this last October in "<a href="https://archive.gyford.com/staff/userland/platformischinesehouseh_28.html">Platform Is Chinese Household</a>." It's great when the platformyou're developing for is taking good care of you, and it'slousy when the platform treats you like an antibody -something to be isolated and defeated. Yuck. Been there,done that.<p>The "Chinese Household" piece still makes good reading:"Today, Macintosh is an empty loveless house. Not a home.All the developers walked but left the babies behind. Notbecause of market share - that can be fixed with economictweaks. We walked because Apple is a lousy lover."<p>The piece got its title from the following metaphor: "Aplatform is a Chinese household. One rich husband. Lots ofwives. If the husband abuses one wife, it hurts all thewives. All of the sudden, food starts getting cold. The bed isempty. All of the sudden, the husband isn't so rich."<p>So ... one more time: market share is a head trip, adistraction.<p>Growth comes from love.<p>Platforms are for fun, profits follow.<h2><pre>A Simple (Yawn) Formula</h2></pre><p>The "Chinese Household" piece painted a grim picture ofApple's prospects. I get no happiness from being right. I'dprefer to have <i>set</i> things right.<p>Since writing that piece, I've held onto the hope thatthe Macintosh OS might have a better future than Apple.After all, it works. I don't particularly want any featuresfrom them - none of the Copland or OpenDoc stuff really getsmy juices flowing. If Apple had to cut back development, sowhat? That would just create new space for me to play in.<p>In the interim, Apple licensed the Mac OS. That seemedlike good news for developers. If we can't make a deal withApple, maybe we can work with a licensee? Unfortunately, thelicensees are approaching the market like cloners, lookingfor ways to add value to their packages by bundling popularapplications. I don't think the cloners are approaching thisas an opportunity to be creative or to try out new ideas. It'sa simple formula: create a clone market for Macintoshes.<p>Yawn.<h2><pre>The End of the Road?</h2></pre><p>It seems that Windows 95 is the final deliverance for theMacintosh operating system, unless it heads for the hills,to niches like multimedia, education, and publishing. Andeventually, Microsoft will grab those niches too. That's theway it works.<p>Apple's trail of tears seems to lead right off a cliff,and there's no evidence that Apple management is doinganything to head in a different direction. Is Apple on itsway to becoming the next Wang, left with no options andnowhere to go, selling off assets to make payroll?<p>A few months ago, <a href="index.htm">Oracle</a> put Apple intoplay, and a new idea took root. A smaller presence takesover Apple and provides it with a new direction. I startedthinking about the situation differently. As the strategicPE ratio of Apple declines, it makes more and more sense fora technologist with a high PE, such as Larry Ellison or nowJim Clark to play "what if" scenarios. What if the Mac OSwas developed as a set-top operating system? What if theMac OS was packaged as the leading Web-browser platform?What if...?<p>You know what I'm interested in - the ideal Internetclient machine. Built out of software that only runs on aMacintosh. Steve Dorner, Aleksandar Totic, Chuck Shotton,Peter Lewis, Leonard Rosenthol, and a few others gettogether, with no one from Apple present, and decide how theproduct goes together. The phoenix rises from the ashes.<p>If you have to head for the hills, head for the hill withthe maximum growth, where Microsoft will have to zig whenthe market wants zag.<p>A newly directed Macintosh could be a friend of theInternet.<p>As I wrote in "<ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/staff/userland/billgatesvstheinternet_17.html">BillGates vs. the Internet</a>" last October, Microsoft must tryto gain control of the standards of the Internet. I thinkthat's inevitable. But another OS vendor canlet the Net community drive the development of the platform.Apple already has lots of high ground in the Internet world.<p>Imagine a new Apple ad, with a big picture of JFK.<p>Underneath the picture, in the standard Apple typeface,"Ask not what the Internet can do for you, but what you cando for the Internet." Below that, two paragraphs expoundingon Apple's new philosophy. Six-color Apple logo in the lowerright corner.<p>It would work!<h2><pre>Where I'm At</h2></pre><p>As a developer, I like to work on the consensus platform,the one that everyone respects. The Apple II was no fun todevelop for in 1983. It had a large installed base, but myideas couldn't take root in that medium; the interestingpeople were using Lotus 1-2-3 machines, not AppleWorksmachines. Same with the IBM PC in 1987 - all the cooldevelopment was happening on the Macintosh. The tide startedturning in 1990 when Windows 3.0 shipped. I stayed with theMacintosh.<p>The value of my Macintosh source code decreased as theplatform's strength dissipated. But with considerable pain,it <i>is</i> portable. The value of the investment can betranslated to value on the consensus platform.<p>I wonder how much my staying with the Mac platform is theresult of fear, rather than love. I definitely have a fearof replacing my Mac desktop with a Windows desktop. So muchcode to convert! But so many of my friends have already doneit. And I get a sense that many more will switch in the nextfew months.<p>There's a lot of pressure on me to give up this fight. Ifit's fear that's driving me, I'll let it go. Take my ownadvice. Let's have fun, Dave. You don't have to go down withthis ship.<p>I'm sorry I can't be more blunt. But there's value inApple's presence in the world. I think even Bill Gates wantssomething called Apple to continue to exist. But it's clearthat the way things are currently configured at Apple is totallyunworkable and goes absolutely nowhere.<p><i>Namaste</i> you-all!<p></dl></dl></dl><dl><dd><img src="stuff/signature.blue.gif" alt="Dave Winer"><dl><dl><dd><pre><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/People/Staff/userland/index.html">DaveNet '95</a>    <a href="mailto:userland@hotwired.com"><i>userland@hotwired.com</i></a></pre><p>P.S. Check out <i>Marketing Warfare</i> by Al Ries andJack Trout. It's a great book. You should be able to find itin the business section of most bookstores. It seems thatRies and Trout would have something to say about the effectsof Windows 95 on the future of Apple Computer. If so, and ifanyone has their email addresses, I'll contact them.<p>P.P.S. A company's "PE ratio" is computed by taking theprice of a share of its stock and dividing it by earningsper share. It's a measure of the perceived longevity of thecompany. Roughly, if a company has a PE ratio of 20, itmeans that the stock market thinks it'll be around for 20years. Apple has a low PE ratio, indicating low marketconfidence in the company. America Online's PE is very high:the market believes in the stock even though profits havebeen elusive. Microsoft's PE ratio is relatively high forsuch a large company. Netscape has an infinite PE ratiobecause it has no profits.<p>P.P.P.S. Apple's ads about Windows 95 make me feel ill. Howwhiny! How defeatist. Sarcasm has no place in advertising.Much better approach: "The Mac is the machine you'll buy foryour kids." Visual message - if you love your kids, theyshould have a Mac to grow up with. Apple needs a positive, lovingmessage that fits well with its reputation outthere in consumerland and holds the space for the Internetclient machine that would ship in early 1996. </dl></dl></dd><pre></pre><p><a href="../signal/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">43 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">8 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
