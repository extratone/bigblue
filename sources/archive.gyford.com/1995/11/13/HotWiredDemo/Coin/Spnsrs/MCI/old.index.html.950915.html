Guggenheim Museum in New York City on June 29.<p>Over the last few days, we dropped some clues about this world-renownedliterary figure and asked everyone who thought they knew the author's trueidentity to send an e-mail to Darlene. <p>The first 100 people who answered correctly will receive a free, autographedcopy of the book.<p><img border=0 src="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/answer.gif"><p>In the meantime, take a tour of Gramercy Press. You'll find that quite a fewthings have changed around here since we staved off that hostile takeover.<p>If you haven't visited us before, we suggest that you take a look at our Helppage. It will familiarize you with our premises and some of the features ofthis site.<P><a href="/cgi-bin/users/imagemap/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/maps/lineup.map><IMG border=0 SRC="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/lineup.gif" ISMAPvspace=3></a><br><i>Click on a Gramercy employee to start your vist.</i><p><IMG SRC="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/black400.gif"><P><P><A HREF="http://www.mci.com/net_mci/net_mci.html"><IMG ALT="click-able image"SRC="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/mcibus.gif"></A><A HREF="http://www.mci.com/index.html"><IMG ALT="click-able image"SRC="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/mci.gif"></A><A HREF="http://www.mci.com/gramercy/help/help.html"><img src="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/Coin/Spnsrs/MCI/graphics/help_lg.gif"></A><P></HTML>
