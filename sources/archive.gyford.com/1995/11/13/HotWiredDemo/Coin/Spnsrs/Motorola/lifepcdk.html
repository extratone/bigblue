And for you. The questions simply become how much and how fast can they do it. Our Power Class and Lifestyle Series desktop modems are as fast as they come. 28.8 V.34. Which translates into faster transfer of data and less time paid for online. And, more time available for opening all those interesting cyberdoors. Sound good? Of course, being Motorolas, there's a whole package of security options and nice bells and whistles all standard. Care to check the specs?
