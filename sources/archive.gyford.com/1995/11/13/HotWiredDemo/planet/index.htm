Hong Kong moves mountains to build the largest hub ever." width=480 height=254><blockquote><dl><dd><h3>In his 1988 book, <cite>Video Night in Kathmandu</cite>, Pico Iyer described HongKong as "the world's great community of transients and refugees ... a dervishingcongregation of self-interests." It is a restless city whose soul is never farfrom the departure gate.<p>For years, the Territory's port of entry has been <a href="kaitak.htm">KaiTak airport</a>, which Iyer called "the Grand Central Station of the Orient." Butafter a half-century of service, Kai Tak will close down, leaving behind some ofthe priciest real estate in Hong Kong.<p>As Kai Tak nears retirement, a new airport is being born at Chek Lap Kok. Itis the largest, costliest <a href="construct.htm">construction</a> project inthe world. An international team of architects, engineers, and planners aretransforming an <a href="ancient.htm">ancient</a> landscape into the flagshipairport of the 21st century. Nearly 20,000 workers will populate the siteby next year, forming several on-site <a href="workers.htm">villages</a>complete with "currency," shops, sports facilities - and some minor socialproblems.<p><img align=left src="stuff/term3DS.gif" width=200 height=136>The environmental impacts of such a major project are extreme, needless tosay. With Chek Lap Kok island now an ecological wasteland, localenvironmentalists have focused their energies on the surrounding littoral zone.There, a rare breed of <a href="dolphins.htm">dolphin</a> struggles to survivein a coastal ecosystem wracked by blasting and reclamation.<p><a href="stuff/inflight.mov"><img align=right border=0 src="stuff/introtea.gif" alt="Quicktime movie: 493k" width=77 height=71></a>Hong Kong's new airport is scheduled to open in 1998 - one year after theterritory's return to Chinese sovereignty. At that time, Chek Lap Kok will be themost sophisticated air <a href="terminal.htm">terminal</a> in Asia, if not the world. It is designed toaccommodate 35 million passengers and almost 3 million tons of cargo a year. Atits heart will be a kilometer-long terminal building,designed by British architect <a href="nfoster.htm">Norman Foster</a>. Itvaguely resembles an intergalactic battle cruiser.<p>An extensive <a href="transpor.htm">transportation</a> network will connectChek Lap Kok to the heart of the city 15 miles away.  A high-speed rail link willwhisk passengers to their planes in less than 30 minutes.  Expressways leading tothe airport will pass over two major bridges, including the longest rail-and-roadsuspension structure in the world.</h3><p>Story and sound recordings by <b>Thomas J.
