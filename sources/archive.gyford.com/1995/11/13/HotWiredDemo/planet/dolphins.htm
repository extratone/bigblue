Explosives have beendetermined to cause severe organ damage or outright death in dolphins. TheWorld-Wide Fund for Nature (Hong Kong) warned that blasting at Chek Lap Kok couldcause a "serious, if not total decline, in the population." According to the<a href="paa.htm">Provisional Airport Authority</a>, mitigation measures were taken. Prior to eachexplosion, the surrounding waters were searched for dolphins. If any were found,blasting was delayed.<p>In April 1995, Hong Kong designated a marine sanctuary for the remainingdolphins. Independent studies being conducted by the Swire Institute of MarineScience at the <a href="http://www.hku.hk/">University of Hong Kong</a> will shedlight on the species and its prospects for survival.</h3></blockquote><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="../images/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="index.htm">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="dolphins.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
