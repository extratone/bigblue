A series of temporary villages are being built toaccommodate them. </blockquote></dl><blockquote><dl><dd><img align=left src="stuff/cooks.gif" width=200 height=127>Although a Spartan architecture and regimented layout gives thevillages the appearance of a penal colony (an impression amplified by occasionalmistranslations into "labor camps"), these modern facilities are endowed with afull complement of urban amenities - theaters, dormitories, clinics, fire andpolice stations, post offices, and banks. Convenience stores, video arcades,sports facilities, and a branch of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club are alsoplanned. When operating at maximum capacity next year, Chek Lap Kok's canteenswill serve 55,000 meals and dish out 12 tons of steamed rice each day.<p><img align=left src="stuff/swipe.gif" width=200 height=127>The worker communities are officially "cash-free," as all transactions usedigital "swipe cards." As in any predominantly male transient community, localprostitution found a booming trade here. How the oldest profession penetrated theisland's tight security is anyone's guess, but the Provisional Airport Authorityclaims that the "problem" has been eliminated.<p>Presumably, those transactions aren't conducted with swipe cards.</h3></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="stuff/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="index.htm">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="workers.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview"></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
