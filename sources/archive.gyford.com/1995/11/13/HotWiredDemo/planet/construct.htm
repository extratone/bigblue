It is so vast that a visit to the site can easily consume an entire day.<p></blockquote></dl><pre><img src="stuff/workcamp.gif" width=240 height=157><img src="stuff/islandbefore.gif" width=240 height=157></pre><blockquote><dl><dd><p>Three islands - The Brothers, Lam Chau, and Chep Lap Kok - were flattened with20 tons of explosives and shoved into the sea, forming a 3,000-acre platform forthe future airport, an area more than three times the size of New York's CentralPark. A flotilla of dredges imported nearly 300 million cubic yards of sand andclay to supplement the site's formation. In all, some 400 million cubic yards ofmaterial will be moved in the course of construction - a quantity equivalent tothe volume of 326 Empire State buildings.<p><img align=right border=0 src="stuff/constea.gif" alt="Quicktime movie: 536k" width=77 height=71>This is a global effort. American earthmovers rumble and Indian <i>Tata</i>pickup trucks scurry around the windswept site, operated by contractors from theNetherlands, Belgium, Japan, Britain, and the United States. The terminal'sfoundation is the product of a consortium of companies from Hong Kong, Japan,China, and the United Kingdom. Services (such as data control) will beprovided by a group Italian, British, and Hong Kong firms. Chek Lap Kok's staffwill hail from 13 different nations.<p><img align=left src="stuff/workers.gif" width=200 height=139>Some of the largest machinery ever used in Southeast Asia is assembled here.At one point, the majority of the world's commercial dredger fleet was moored atChek Lap Kok, including the <i>J. F. J de Nul</i> - among thelargest dredgers ever built.<p>The huge dump trucks used in the preparation of the site are idle now, theirlabor done.  The machines, each capable of hauling 147 tons of rock, are forsale: to acquire a handy new toy for your garden, phone the <ahref="paa.htm">Provisional Airport Authority</a> at +1 (852) 8247724 and ask for Ms. Stella Fok.</h3></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="stuff/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="index.htm">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="construct.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/copyrigh.html">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
