The island has supported human culture for well over3,500 years. When it became clear in 1989 that Hong Kong's new airport wouldrequire the leveling of Chek Lap Kok, the Hong Kong Archeological Society began aseries of studies to determine the extent of the island's buried history.According to the Society, such work produced evidence of human occupation duringthe late Tang and Sung Dynasties (8th to 13th centuries AD) and the Neolithicperiod (4000 to 1500 BC).<p><img align=left src="stuff/arcs.gif" width=200 height=141>In the months prior to construction, many artifacts were unearthed. Abandonedirrigation systems, burial grounds, coins and tools, limekilns, pottery, andceramics - all were brought to light, providing a wealth of information about HongKong's early history. Many of these artifacts have been cataloged and placed onexhibit.<p><img align=left src="stuff/tinhau.gif" width=200 height=141>Until recently, Chek Lap Kok was an island of small agricultural and fishingvillages half a world away from the twittering (<a href="stuff/nokia.aif"><img src="stuff/aiff.gif" border=0 alt="aiff" width=20 height=12></a> 84k, <a href="stuff/nokia.aif"><img src="stuff/raudio.gif" border=0 alt="Real Audio" width=50 height=12></a> 2 seconds) mobilephones of Hong Kong. At Ah Ma Man, a diminutive temple to the sea goddess Tin Hauhas stood since 1823. The Antiquities and Monuments Office supervised thestone-by-stone removal of the old building to a more secure site in Tung Chung.<p>The island of Chek Lap Kok is itself history now, altered beyond recognitionby explosives and earthmovers. Only a tiny portion of the original island willremain as a nature preserve and sound barrier - an island of history on an isleof the info age.</h3></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="stuff/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="index.htm">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="ancient.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview"></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
