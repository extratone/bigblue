British architect Norman Foster has already designed one of HongKong's most lauded landmarks - the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Completed in 1985,and one of the costliest office buildings ever constructed, it was intended to besimply "the best bank building in the world."The steel-and-glass structureresembles a Goliath erector set looming above Hong Kong's Central district. Iteven appears on the Territory's banknotes.<p>"The bank," as it is known in Hong Kong, brought the architect internationalcelebrity status. Few then were surprised when Foster managed to land the airportterminal project - one of the choicest commissions in the current architecturaluniverse.<p>Norman Foster is no stranger to transportation projects. He designed theInternational Terminal at Stansted Airport in London, theBritish Rail terminal at King's Cross, and is currently building a commuter railstation in Kowloon, Hong Kong. And as the pilot of his own helicopter, NormanFoster is no stranger to aviation.</h3></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="../images/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/planet/">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/planet/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="nfoster.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "https://archive.gyford.com/full.copyright.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
