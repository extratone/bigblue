Built by the Japanese duringWorld War II, its runway was constructed with the walls of a 19th-century fort.On one side is a stinking nullah, on the other, the turquoise waters of VictoriaHarbor.<p>On final approach to Kai Tak, travelers must endure one of commercialaviation's most gut-wrenching finales. If you can resist the urge to drop thewindow shade, the experience will restore your faith in God, man, and Boeing. Theairport is tucked amid steep hills, a busy harbor, and thickly populated urbandistricts. Kai Tak is the eye of a needle, and you are a flying piece of thread.<p><img align=left src="stuff/turn.gif" width=200 height=127>Only seasoned pilots attempt "Approach 13," the roof-skimming inbound routeover Kowloon. During landing, the plane comes so close to apartments that you cansee the flicker of television sets. A sharp bank to the right lines the craft upwith the runway. The cue for this critical maneuver? Not a sophisticatednavigation aid, but a giant red-and-white checkerboard painted on a hillside.Sudden adjustments to trim or power evoke a specter of hands trembling at thecontrols. Visions of a fiery death haunt even well-seasoned travelers, andapplause at touchdown is common.<p><img align=left src="stuff/soup.gif" width=200 height=107>Despite nightmare scenarios of an urban crash-landing, Kai Tak enjoys one ofthe best safety records of any airport in the world. There have only been threemajor accidents the past decade, the most recent involving a 747 that skiddedoff the end of the runway.<p>The closing of Kai Tak will break few hearts, however. When the last planetouches down in 1998, thousands of residents living directly under its flightpath will enjoy for the first time in decades a life uninterrupted by the scream (<ahref="stuff/turbine.aif"><img src="stuff/raudio.gif" border=0 alt="Real Audio" width=50 height=12></a> 23 seconds, <ahref="stuff/turbine.aif"><img src="stuff/aiff.gif" border=0 alt="aiff" width=20 height=12></a> 532k) of aircraft overhead.</h3></dl><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><h3><img src="stuff/archive.gif" align=left alt=" ">Current <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/planet/">Planet Wired</a><br></h3><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/planet/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="kaitak.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">6 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">46 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
