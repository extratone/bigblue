And theycame fearfully. One look at the place and you wonder why they came atall. But the land was there for the taking, so they took. Manyexplorers perished blazing the red sand trail to - where? - The DeadHeart. A whitefella named Gosse found and climbed Ayers Rock in1873. Alice Springs had been established just three years before, in1870. There was no railway to Alice until 1929, no paved road untilWorld War II. The men drawn to this frontier were hard and reckless.<p>Predictably, violence accompanied the white invasion: Aboriginalsstole cattle, white men killed Aboriginals. Missionaries broughtstrange gods - smallpox and rum came along for the ride.<p>These days, the Aboriginals just want to be left alone. Many nowlive on their own land, subject to tribal law, the simple code of aneye for an eye. They carry the wisdom of 40,000 years.</h3></table><Pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="white.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "https://archive.gyford.com/full.copyright.html">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
