It's the biggest monolith on the planet, andgeologists reckon two-thirds of it lies underground. It's the perfectsymbol of the Australian Outback - hard, unforgiving, frighteninglyancient, silent, and still.<p><img align=left src="stuff/tjuta.gif" width=250 height=155>Uluru, the aboriginal name for Ayer's Rock, translates as "meetingplace." Kata Tjuta, a nearby labyrinth of rounded rock outcrops, means"many heads." These landmarks and the surrounding plains of gum trees,mulga, and spinifex were designated a national park in 1958. The parkwas then handed back to the Anangu tribe in 1985. They lease it to theNational Parks Service, and in return, they receive A$75,000 (aboutUS$55,000) a year and 20 percent of the entrance fees.  The 30,000-oddannual visitors pay A$10 (about US$7) each. The park was <ahref="auswha.htm">WorldHeritage</a>-listed for its natural value in 1987, and for itscultural value in 1994.<p><img align=left src="stuff/rock1.gif" width=250 height=155>The first thing everyone wants to do when they get here is to climbUluru, but that's a tacky and dangerous activity. More than a dozenclimbers have been killed, and some clown gets into trouble every fewdays. The Anagu conduct initiation ceremonies here, usually in cavesoff-limits to visitors.  Occasionally, the entire park is closed forthis reason. The Anagu prefer that no one climb Uluru, though theytolerate the activity. They are very disturbed by the accidents anddeaths, and look forward to the day - perhaps not too-distant - whenthe trail is closed. In one local language, the word for theubiquitous black ant is "minga." It is the same word for tourist.<p>Uluru National Park is about as happy as a weird, cross-culturalmarriage-of-convenience gets. The Anagu have the controlling intereston the Park's Board of Management; the Chair is Anagu and the meetingsare bilingual in Pitjantjatjara and English. No park developmentoccurs without Anagu consultation. It's a delicate balancing act: inreturn for about $700,000 (almost US$513,000) a year, they exposetheir sanctum sanctorum to the masses. But they retain ultimatecontrol.</h3></table><blockquote><Pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="rock.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview"></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">9 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">21 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/full.copyright.html">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
