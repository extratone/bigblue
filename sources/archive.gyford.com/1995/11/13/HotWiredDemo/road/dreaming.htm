It's a dry, dead, featureless landscape -there's just <i>nothing</i> here, and the emptiness isthreatening. Bring back the forests, I think to myself, turn back thedial 150 million years to the time when Australia was lush andequatorial. Of course, I <i>would</i> think that. I'm a white boy.<p>Those who do know the land's secrets know them from age-oldstories. These tales, different for each tribe, describe many things:how the land's hills and waterholes were formed by humans andancestral beings; how to navigate; where to find food and rare andprecious water. A man without water can die in the summer heat in asingle day.<p><img align=left src="stuff/dreamt2.gif" width=250 height=142>The stories - the only history that exists in traditional Aboriginalculture - are creation myths. Landforms mark places where ancestralbeings fought, played, or slept. The legends surrounding Uluru (AyersRock), for instance, read like news from Bosnia. Such sacred sites areof crucial importance to Aboriginals. To someone not grounded in thesestories, collectively called The Dreaming, the Australian Outbackholds very little meaning.</h3></table><blockquote><Pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/road/index.html"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/road/dreaming.html"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
