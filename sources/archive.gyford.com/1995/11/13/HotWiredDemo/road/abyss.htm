I love the name. You expect castles and sauerkraut, butall you get in "the Rome of Central Australia" is dreams and dust.<p>German Lutheran pastors established Hermansburg in 1876. AlbertNamatjira, the most famous Aboriginal artist, was born here, as wasTed Strehlow, who grew up with the local Aranda people and becametheir first deserving linguist and anthropologist. They gave him vastnumbers of sacred objects, which are now locked in a vault in AliceSprings. Who should have them is hotly disputed; it is forbidden forthe uninitiated to see them.<p> <img align=left src="stuff/canyon.gif" width=250 height=155>An hour's rough ride south is Palm Valley, an oasis of water andunique palm trees on the Finke River, the oldest active watercourse onearth, at 150 million years. From here, I backtrack to hit the new,unpaved Mereenie Loop Road forging its way out to rugged WatarrkaNational Park and King's Canyon.<p>A three-hour canyon rim walk - wild, free, and mindblowing -reveals the Lost City, a maze of weathered sandstone domes, and theGarden of Eden, a palm-rimmed waterhole tucked secretly away in theheart of the canyon. It's remote, but the tour buses have found it:the multi award-winning Aboriginal-owned resort of King's Canyon, fromwhere tourists take Aboriginal-run tours of local rock art sites. It'sthe sort of place that haunts your dreams.<p>Southwards, it's 200-plus kilometers (130 miles) to the nextsurface water, at Curtin Springs cattle station. Nearby Mount Conner,a massive and sacred 700 million-year-old mesa just four meters lowerthan Uluru, is accessible only by tour from Yulara, Uluru's adjacentresort.</h3></table><blockquote><Pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="abyss.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview"></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
