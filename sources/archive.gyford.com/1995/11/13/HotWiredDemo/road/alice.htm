One-tenth of its 25,000 residents are Aboriginal. The towngot its start as a repeater station on the Overland Telegraph Line,which ran through Indonesia, Burma, India, and clear across toLondon. This was the Net's big daddy - Australia's first internationalcommunications system. The station was built beside a natural spring;Alice was the boss's wife.<p>Alice Springs grew slowly: In 1925, it had just 200 residents, andeven now is the biggest settlement for 1,500 kilometers (1,000 miles)in all directions. It's the center of a booming tourist industry,based around Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Aboriginal culture. Racialproblems still exist, but nothing like the bad old days. This is theonly place on this trip where most of The Dreaming is whitefellastuff.<p>Red earth, red rock, ruddy red skin confront you everywhere youturn. Even the sun turns red, too, when it drops - but the surroundinghills, the MacDonnell Ranges, turn an intense blue, as if internallylit. The hills form a protective ring that almost appears to keep thefrightening void of the desert at bay.  Nearby, red scars mark the drycourses where mineralized, ultra-healthy water occasionally flows;farther out, red kangaroos and wallabies haunt the ranges.<p><img align=left src="stuff/gorge.gif" width=190 height=250>Permanent waterholes - 60 million years in the making - floor breezygorges in West MacDonnell National Park. Stimpson's Gap, StanleyChasm, Ellery Creek, Serpentine Gorge, Ormiston Gorge, and Glen HelenGorge are sunk into 1.8 billion-year-old rock formations, the oldeston this oldest of all continents. A 220 kilometer (140 mile) walkingtrail, the Larapinta, is currently being forged through the park. Ifyou want to hike it, do so in winter, June to September.  </h3></table> <blockquote> <Pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="alice.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
