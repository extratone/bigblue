But, hey, you know, they gotta pay<em>their</em> property taxes, too, same as you and I.  So hopefully,if it costs ya a couple of bucks, you'll get a couple of bucks'worth of chuckles, and it's cheaper than going to the movies thesedays.<p>This little weird-n-wacky travelog starts at Leggett Valley, atthe intersection of Highways 1 and 101, and works north along 101 until it hits "Avenue of the Giants."  There it takes offonto the Avenue and continues another 33 miles along The Avenue.The things on this travelog are my "personal picks" of the manyoff-the-wall tourist sights here in redwoods country.</h4><p><hr><p><ol><h3>  <li>The Chandelier Drive-Thru Tree</h3><p>Click here for a picture of<ahref="index.htm">the Drive-Thru Tree.</a><p>Yep. You can drive right thru this tree.  Hole as big as a Buickthrough it.  One of three drive-thru trees in California, and inmy opinion, the best of the bunch.  <p>You'll drive through a beautiful redwood forest, and around the bendyou'll suddenly come upon the tree itself.  Go ahead -- <em>be el touristo</em>,have someone take your picture in front of the tree; every one else does!<p>After you've gone through the tree, park and look back at the tree.  It really is a magnificent specimen of a coastal redwood!<p>The tree is at the south end of Leggett, on Drive-Thru Tree Road(pretty clever of 'em, eh?, to get the State to name the roadafter their tourist trap!)<p><h3> <li>Leggett's Crackerjack Duckpond</h3>Well, the truth is, the Leggett Duckpond doesn't exist any more.  But you can still go see where it <em>was</em>.<p>What's the Leggett Duckpond's main claim-to-fame?  Well, in the early 1970sRobert Pirsig and his sontook their famous motorcycleride across America, and down the Pacific Coast, and wrote about the trip <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,</em> theyrelate that "we stopped to feed the ducks in the tourist duckpond atLeggett."  <p>Yep.  Fed 'em crackerjacks.  Says so right here on page 399of my copy of "Zen." <p>The spot ought to have a shrine and be a pilgrimage site for all the Zen-Trekkies in the world!  But it isn't.  Alas, it was pavedover when the new Highway 1 & 101 intersection was put in.  Butright there at the intersection, just beside the "Carvings for Christ"redwood chainsaw carving shop, under the pavement, is where the Cracker Jacktourist duck pond once was.<p>I suppose, in a bit of spiritual homage to the duckpond, one could stillfeed crackerjacks to the ducks at duckpond over at the Drive-Thru Tree, sortof a communing-in-memorium to the lost duckpond in "Zen."  It wouldn'tbe quite the same, but it would come close.<p><h3><li>The Peg House Deli</h3>Click here to see the <ahref="index.htm">Peg House Delicatessen</a><p>Two miles north on Highway 101 there's the Peg House Deli.  Someone oncegot the idea to build this place without any nails, all with woodenpegs.  And they did, too!  There's not a nail in the place.  I doubtyou could even buy a box of nails in their little hardware section.<p>But you can see the bullet holes from the shoot out down the road a few years ago, between the cops and some bad guys.  Ask owners Stan or Beverly to show them to you.  They knew the bullets werecoming through the side window, but they didn't know where the landed, 'til they realized one had passed through a loaf of bread; that showed the trajectory, and the ballistics guys dug out the bullets from the far wall.<p><h3> <li>The Bell Glen Stage Stop</h3><p>Click here for a picture of<ahref="index.htm">the old stage coach stop at Bell Glen.</a><p>Stage coaches used to run all over northern California.  The building thatis now the dining room and pub at the Bell Glen Bed and Breakfastand the Bell Glen Bunk'n'Breakfast hostel, was a stage stop on thePinkerton line.  They even have an old mail pouch from the stagein the pub downstairs.  And owner Gene barnett can show you oldwheel ruts from the stage, where it used to cross the Eel River on the way to the stage stop.  The Bell Glen is another half-milenorth of Peg House.<p><h3>  <li>Howling Wolf Lodge</h3>It was called "Howling Wolf" because they did, indeed, have howling wolveshere; also, trumpeting elephants, and bears, and cougars, and such.<p>Howling Wolf, you see, was a retirement home for over-the-hill movie animals.  Thebear was Walt Disney's Gentle Ben; the elephant was the elephantfrom Daktari; and the cougar was the cougar from the MercuryCougar commercials.<p>It's a private residence, now, so don't disturb the occupants, but if you want to see the location, it's the long low building at 71700 Highway 101, on the west side of the road.<p><h3><li>Grundy's World-Famous He-She House</h3>Before it was known as Howling Wolf, the Howling Wolf was known as "Grundy's" --basically, a bar and restaurant.  The weird and wacky thing at Grundy's was the restroom (or more precisely, the outhouse) -- a redwood log, hollowedinward from both ends, meeting in the middle.  One end was marked "HE"and was the men's side of the outhouse; the other end was marked "SHE" and was the women's side.<p>No one knowswhere the World-Famous Tree House went.  To that Great Outhouse-In-The-Sky,I suppose.<p><h3><li>The World-Famous Tree House</h3><p>Click here for a picture of<ahref="index.htm">the World-Famous Tree House.</a><p>Oh, this has to be the biggest tourist trap on all of 101, and one of the best.  Free, too, so it's definitely worth a stop.  Calledthe World-Famous Tree House because it was in <em>Ripley's Believe-it-or-Not</em>back in the 1930s as "the tallest one-room house in the world,"and it's been living off that reputation ever since.<p>The inside of the tree is spectacular.  Burned out completely hollowin a forest fire about 300 years ago, and still living andperfectly healthy.  Truly glorious.  You can still see the charcoal pn the inside of the tree from the forest fire, and it's burned out ashigh as a five-story building inside!<p>Now here's one place where I want you to blow a couple of quarters.  Fifty cents, total; less than a bag of popcorn at the movies, and better for your heart.<p>There are two small animated displays in the Treehouse.  Putone quarter in the blacksmith shop, and another in the sawmill.  Watch'em whirl and bang, and cut logs, and shoe horses, and play checkers.<p>And if you have a little one with you, blow another quarter on thelittle miniature merry-go-round.  If you <em>really</em> want to be a big spender for the little one, put your fourth quarter in the loggingtrain inside the gift shop.  Total cost, for all the adults and all the littleones together?  One dollar.  Such a deal!<p>Now I'll let you in on a little secret.  Ripley called the Tree House "the tallest one-roomhouse in the world," but in fact, no one ever "lived" in the treehouse.  It started out as a tourist donut shop.<p>The only people who've ever even slept in the tree house was aroad construction crew who put cots in it and slept there for abouta week when they were building the road back in the '20s.  Theirpicture is on the wall.<p><h3><li>Confusing Hill</h3><p>Click here for a gravity-defying look into <ahref="index.htm">the Anti-Gravity House.</a><br>Click here for a picture of<ahref="index.htm">Old Mother Hubbard's Wooden Shoe</a><br>Click here for a picture of the<ahref="index.htm">train ride</a><p>Well, it's real name is "Confusion Hill," but I come out so confused that I call it "Confusing Hill."  You could call it "Gravity-Run-AmokHill," and you'd be right-on.<p>Water runs up hill.  You can't stand up straight in the house; Gravityacts differently in the north-south direction than it does in theeast-west direction.  Your child looks taller than you do.<p>Oh, the vertigo of it all!  I remember seeing Confusion Hill on an old black-and-white tv program called <em>You Asked For It</em> back in the 50s.  It's the first tv program I ever remember seeing.  On a farm down in Potosi Missouri.  And it's still there (Confusion Hill, I mean; not the farm in Potosi.)<p>Take the logging museum train ride, too, up into the hills to see logging equipment from each decade of the 1900s (more, or less).<p>Have a little one along?  He or she will love the Old Mother Hubbard Shoemade out of redwood.  And the world's talles redwood carving,dancing bears chainsaw-carved out of the stump of a tree that lost it's top many years ago.<p><h3><li>The Grandfather Tree</h3>The behemoth of a tree (52 feet (17m) in circumference) is an awesomesight.  Although it's the centerpiece of a gift shop, the visit to thetree is free, and you can browse the gift shop for some of the highest-quality redwood objets d'art in redwood country.  Even pieces as largeas furniture can be shipped anywhere in the world for you.<p><h3><li>Oh, if the Walls Could Talk ...</h3>If the walls of Cabin 74 at Hartsook Inn could talk, maybethey'd whisper a bit of Clark Gable and Carol Lombard's pillowtalk to us, for the famous couple honeymooned in that very cabin, more than 50 years ago!<p><h3><li>The World-Famous Piercy Post Office Walk-Thru Tree</h3>Before the 1964 floods the town of Piercy had its post office where Richardson Grove State park now is. To find teh site of the World-Famous Piercy Post Office Walk-Thru Tree, gointo Richardson Grove, drive around to the Visitor Center; park and walk to thefar corner of the Visitor Center and see the two trees with the hole throughthem.  These trees were the actual doorway to the Piercy Post Office.  In1964 the post office washed away in the floods, and no trace of it remains.<p><h3><li>The World's Biggest Abalone Shell</h3>Well, now it's the world's <em>second biggest,</em> 'cuz it got beat by abouthalf-an-inch a year ago.  But it <em>was</em> the biggest, and stillis worth seeing.  Look in Brown's Sporting Goods in Garberville, in the back,in the display case holding the shell.<p>It's hard to tell the age of an abalone, but this one isbelieved to be the world's oldest.  And at 12 pounds, it's also the world's heaviest.<ul><p><li>Trivia questions:  How old does an abalone get?  And howdo you determine it's age?<p><li>Trivia answers:  This one is believed to be about 120 years old.A baby abalone has a reddish-pink interior; as it ages, the reddishnessfades back toward the outer edge.  You just guess by how muchfading has taken place in the red.</ul><p><h3><li>"George Washington Never Slept Here"</h3>Click here for a picture of<ahref="index.htm">the One-Log House</a><br>Click here to see a historic picture of the One-Log House<ahref="index.htm">on its old truck.</a><p>North of Garberville, turn right onto Avenue of the Giants.  AtPhillipsville, you'll come to the One-Log House: A three-room house hand-chiseled into a single log of a redwood tree.<p>The motto of the tree?  "George Washington Never Slept Here."But I'll bet ol' George <em>would've</em> slept here if he had the chance!<p>The house is on a truck, and has traveled all over the world.  I once saw apicture of it in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.<p><h3><li>The Curly-Cue Bridge Rails</h3>At first, the guard rails on the bridge at "Bridges Creek," on Avenue of the Giants, look like they are made from concrete.  But up close, yousee they are hand-hewn redwood timbers, from an era whenpublic buildings and bridges were made more decorativeand ornate than today's efficient public works projects.<p><h3><li>The Lincoln Logs Bridge</h3>At Robinson Grove, you can turn west and pass beneath the old Avenue of the Giants to a beautiful forest on the banks of the Eel River.  On the left as you pass through the forestyou'll easily see the magnificent undercribbing to theAvenue of the Giants' road bed. <p>The undercribbing is a fascinating feat of engineering, usinghundreds and hundreds of redwood logs, all interlaced together, to form a bridge across the canyon that the Avenue traverses high above you.<p><h3><li>  Video of the Christmas Floods of 1964</h3>In 1964, massive flooding of the Eel and four other rivers in northern California destroyed 135 bridges,several towns and hundreds of miles of highway and railroad lines.At the Humboldt Redwoods Visitor Center in Weott,ask the rangers to show you films of the 1964 flood.<h3><li>The Little Town That Isn't There Anymore</h3><p>The town of Weott was one of the towns that obliteratedby the 1964 flood.  Near the intersection of the Avenue and tbd road, look for the sign that shows the high-watermark on -- 235 feet up in the air -- at what once wasthe main street of the town.  You can still see sidewalksand driveways from before the 64 flood.<h3><li>The World's Ugliest Tree</h3>Click to see a strange<ahref="index.htm">"dawn redwood"</a>that turns brilliant orange in the fall<p>Before 1948, only two kinds of redwoods were known -- the coastal and the giant redwoods.  In 1948 a rare "dawn" redwood was found in remote mountainsof China; these dawn redwoods turn out to be remnants oftrees that existed before the Ice Age.<p>One dawn redwood is across the street from the high-watermark in Weott.  Trust me.  I'm an authority on ugly trees, and this is dawn redwood in Weott is theworld's ugliest.  Some kind of a genetic defecthas caused dozens and dozens of trunks to grow out of the rootswhere only one trunk should be.  The whole tree is contorted into a twisting mass of weirdness.  And anotherweird thing about this tree -- it's deciduous; it loses its needles inwinter and re-blooms them again in the spring.<p>But who knows?  Perhaps there is something really potentabout this genetic defect, and it might propgate and repropgate and repropogate, and some day it might becomethe dominant strain and all the rest of the redwoods as we know them today might look weirdto our descendants ten million years from now. <h3><li>Star Wars Filming</h3>Some of the land rover scenes from Star Wars III were filmed in the Women's Federation Grove.  Turn in and check it out;you'll recognize it.<p><h3><li>An Albino Redwood Tree</h3>Click here to see an<ahref="index.htm">albino redwood tree!</a>    <p>Yes, there are albino redwood trees, colorless trees with no     chlorophyll.  Their branches and needles are almost pure white.      Because they lack chlorophyll, they can't make food on their     own and they live as parasites on the roots of healthy redwoods.    One rare albino redwood is in the Women's Federation    Grove, on the banks of a small creek that runs through    the grove near the park entrance.  Ask a ranger to     point you toward the tree.    Please don't pick souvenier branches from the albino; albinos     are rare trees and surely perform some unknown function in Mother     Nature's scheme of things.  Enjoy it, take pictures, but don't     molest the tree.<p><h3><li>The Redwood Graveyard</h3>Mother nature at work ... all these beautiful trees, smashed up in windstorms, burned up in forest fires, heaped humble-jumble on top of each other .. all makingroom for Mother Nature's next generation of her magnificenthandywork.<p>From the parking area at Founders' Grove, walk over to thebeautiful Founder's Tree (the first branch on Founder'stree is 20-stories up in the sky -- the <em>first branch!</em>)<p>After you've ga-ga'd at Founders' tree a while, you willwant to take the nature path back to the redwood graveyard.Ignore the state park's signs telling you which way to go.Listen to me; I'm the expert!  Instead of going to the leftaround the tree as the signs say, you go to the right! Aftera short walk you'll come to a beautiful burned-out tree stump, and then the Redwood Graveyard; the only way to describe thisgraveyard is, "PREHISTORIC."  Watch out for the dinasours!<p><h3><li>The World's Longest Laying-Down Tree</h3>Click here for a picture of the <ahref="index.htm">Dyerville Giant</a>Once there was a controversy about this tree -- was it now the tallest tree in the world, orwas the one at Klamath that claimed to be the tallest actually the heightchampion?  The Klamath tree had stopped growning, but the tree at Founder's Grove, called the <em>Dyerville Giant</em> was still living in the top,and still growing even taller.<p>Plans were being made to re-measure the Giant when it was struck by another falling tree in a windstorm, and on the night of March 28, 1991, came crashing to the ground, no longer acontender for the world championship!<p>But oh, what a tree it was.  And laying on its side, back in the redwood graveyard,it's even more impressive on its side than standing up, foron it's side it you can take the true measure of the tree by walking up to it, walking along and around it.  You can sense thehulk of the tree, the age and history of the tree.<p>"Awesome" is the only word to describe it.  The undisputablechampion for its new title, "the world's longest fallen-down tree,"</ol> <p><hr><h3>Where to Stay in Redwoods Country<p></h3><h4>Click here to read about the<ahref="index.htm">Bell Glen Resort in the Redwoods</a></h4><p><hr><p><h3><a name="weirdpak"></a>Summary of this Travelog</h3><h4>For an e-mail summary of this travelog that you can print on your printer,tuck in your travel folder and bring with you as your personaltravel guide when you come to redwood country, press <ahref="index.htm">here.</a>  <p><hr><p><p><h2>Electronic Communications about this Web Page</h2><p><li><a name="wrdmail"></a>Press <ahref="index.htm">here</a>to send me e-mail -- comments, questions or reservations at the Bell Glen Resort.<!--<p>web-catcher keywords:<br>weird<br>cool<br>tourist trap<br>b&b<br>bed and breakfast<br>hostel<br>hosteling<br>hostelling<br>retreat<br>redwoods<br>humboldt<br>avenue of the giants<br>bike<br>biking<br>bicycling<br>touring<BR>travel<br>mendocino<br>rustic<br>cabin<br>ayh<br>dyerville<br>zen<br>zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance<br>--></body></html>
