<h3><p>You must admit, a sign at the <a
href="fairymea.htm">Fairy
Meadow Hut</a> that reads, this "hut is NOT in the area marked Fairy
Meadow" can give a weary climber pause.

Since its founding in 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada has provided useful 
aid
and info to its member mountaineers and outdoor enthusiasts.

Or so they say. It could also be that the ACC is really a cadre of secret
agents whose headquarters are located in this decentralized group of 
<a 
href="fairymea.htm">mountain 
huts</a>
connected by a network of tunnels.

<h3><p>Washington state's 
<A 
HREF="project.htm">MuDSLuTs</A>

may leave smut-searching senators sullen, but the SLuTs's multifaceted,
muck-spattered site will leave mountain bike enthusiasts lusting for more.

Although the MuDSLuTs claim to advocate "fair and open access" in "Country,
City, and Cyburbia," this site seems to lack the environmental ethic that 
many
consider essential to the spirit of mountain biking.</h3>

<h3><p>Is it true that the game of Frisbee Golf was invented by
ancient Celts who played the game with large stones, and later
abandoned it altogether when entire clans were laid up with head
traumas?

<p> What's fact and fiction with this elusive sport? The <a
href="wfdf.htm">World Flying Disc
Federation</a> takes a stab at putting it to paper, a risky prospect for a 
game
whose rules are always up in the air.</h3>

<h3><p>Day one at the Mammoth Mountain downhill, and psychocyclist 
<a 
href="missy.htm">

Missy Giove</a> has already made a trip to the local ER with a
busted thumb carpal, and strips of her raw flesh are flapping in the
mountain breeze.  Earlier she'd taken a 15-foot dive into the dirt in
a practice shoot down Mammoth's legendary Kamikaze run. Later that
night her body was too wracked to make it to the bathroom so Giove
treated the downstairs neighbors to an impromptu rainstorm direct from
her second-floor balcony. </h3>

<h3><p>Show us Main Street in Anytown and we'll point to a spot where
lawlesss punks regularly go head-to-head with the fuzz over inane
skateboarding prohibitions.  Check the laws in <a

Carolina</a>:

<OL> 
<LI> No skateboards on sidewalks <LI> No skateboards on the streets

And people wonder why kids take to the grass.

(A tip for the fellas: a spell-checker is a handy addition to the arsenal 
of
any dedicated revolutionary.)</h3>

<h3><p>Had Pee Wee Herman known that the chances of recovering a
stolen bicycle are slightly better than getting fried by lightning,
there may never have been a Big Adventure.

Sad-faced cyclists who've had their prize possessions snatched away
might want to post their bikes' vital stats with the 
<A HREF="stolen.htm">Stolen Bike
Registry</A>. You may never see your bike again, but you'll feel
better knowing you made the effort.  </h3>
