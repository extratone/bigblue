 <P>Boone, North Carolina has a skate scene, believe it or not.  
Unfortunately Boone only has about 2 places to skate, and only one of 
them is legal.  The citizens of Boone feel that us skate kids shouldn't 
recieve the same rights as our fellow <a href="index.htm">mountain-bikers</a>, 
roller-bladers, <a 
href="index.htm">skydivers</a>, 
<a href="index.htm">rugby players</a>, <a 
href="index.htm">kayakers</a>, <a 
href="index.htm">wrestlers</a>, <a 
href="index.htm">joggers</a>, <a 
href="index.htm">snowboarders</a>,
dog-walkers, people-walkers, walker-walkers, and other such activies 
pertaining to motion.  So far, though I know no one who has seen the 
actual documintation of these laws, according campus securrity, and local 
police, Boones anti-skate laws are:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>1.  NO SKATEBOARDS ON ANY SIDEWALKS.  (So one moves to the 
	streets.  But lookout for law #2.)
<LI>2.  NO SKATEBOARDS ON ANY STREET...ANYWHERE IN BOONE.  (Sucks eggs.)
<LI>3.  NO SKATEBOARDS ON APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.  (This one 
really sucks.  ASU is covered with stairs, bumps, and other well lit 
night spots, all out of harms way.  All of these spots are open for every 
bike, rollerblade, frizbie, <a 
href="index.htm">hacky-sackers</a>, football, dog, snake, pot/deadhead, 
jogger, fisherman, and anyother sport and activity you can think of...BUT 
NO SKATEBOARDS.  <em>I sense injustice</em>.)

<P>Well enough about the injustices all fellow skatebrats experience, 
though we are just as much apart of America as Toyota.  Here are a few 
internet skate spots that found.</P>
