<b>JIM McROY craved an audience with the Queen of DH, the 'Missile', the 
inimitable, Missy Giove. But, as he found out, the crown was easy pickings 
compared with her battle to win through the pain 
barrier.</b></center><p>Missy Giove has just been crowned World Champion 
in the Downhill, a fitting end to a season which saw her lose the number 
one spot in the World Cup in the very last race; a season which started 
with her lying in hospital with a cracked pelvis and continued with a 
series of crash-test dummy incidents which will necessitate hours of 
surgery over the winter. Yet Missy's race at Mammoth in 1994 will long be 
remembered by her friends and associates as her most courageous yet. Why? 
Read on...<p>
	"Latte?" Missy asks. Not being au fait with the various US coffee 
concoctions, I ask what it is and Missy describes it as an extra milky 
cappuccino. It is her favourite drink and its caffeine content her only 
stimulant. Being brought up in New York alerted her at an early age to the 
horrors of alcohol and drug abuse, but today, the day of the Kamikaze and 
Grundig Downhills, Giove looks as if she will need a bit more than just a 
cup of coffee to get her going. <p>
Crash, bang... ouch

Missy, in her normal impish fashion, had agreed to the interview, but only 
if I rode the Kamikaze first. On the day before her downhill races she 
agreed to meet me after her practice session and we would ride the 
downhill together, with her demonstrating slowly (oh, how I prayed) how 
she would attack the course. I made out my will and took the cable car to 
the top of Mammoth Mountain with the group of other journos who also 
demonstrated cerebral impairment by being there, but Missy was nowhere to 
be seen. <p>
	I rode the course at around a fifth of the speed the pros would, but this 
was only because that was the slowest my bike would go with both brakes 
locked on and the wheels sliding through the two-inch thick layer of dust 
that covered the track. Hanging off the back in the recommended manner 
with the death grip applied to both brakes, I was a very relieved and 
happy bunny indeed when I reached the bottom unscathed. It was there that 
I learned that Missy had not been quite so lucky and had been carted off 
to hospital after crashing badly high up on the track, and that the 
prospects of her being allowed out, let alone with the intention of racing 
the following day, were very slim. <p>
	So, it's nine thirty the next morning and I am at Missy's condo, gazing 
in admiration as she struggles to get ready for the race. I ask her about 
the crash. "I was hammering the course with Myles (Rockwell, her Volvo 
Cannondale teammate), goin' at race pace and on the worst possible part of 
the course you could get a flat, I got one. I couldn't see what was goin' 
on 'cos the course was very dusty and Myles was kickin' up a storm in 
front of me. The next thing I knew was my rim had folded and before I had 
time to react my bike had gone over the bank. I fell off and rolled over 
the cliff edge, droppin' about fifteen feet on to a whole bunch of 
boulders." Missy  was whisked off to hospital where it was discovered that 
as well as being bruised from head to foot she had broken a carpal in her 
thumb, with another possible break in her hand.<p>
