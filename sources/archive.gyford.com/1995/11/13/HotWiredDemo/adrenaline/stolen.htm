<STRONG>Welcome!</STRONG> Well, I once heard the chances of getting 
back a stolen bike are slightly greater than that of being hit by lightning, 
but less than the chance you might win the lottery. Having lost bikes to 
thieves, I found that rather disheartening. The major reason the odds 
are so low is stolen bikes are a low priority to most police departments. 
They can be virtually impossible to track and require to much valuable 
time to do a complete investigation. 
<P>
To help improve these odds the Registry was started. If you have lost a bike 
feel free to enter your information below. Please fill in all of the sections on
the form. If you haven't lost a bike, but would like to help add this page to your 
hotlist. Swing by periodically and print a few copies of the info. Drop these off 
at your local bike shops and the local police department. <STRONG><I>The more 
people participate, the better this will work.</I></STRONG>
<HR>
<STRONG>NEW!!!, you can now register your bike before it is stolen so you have an 
accurate record of it. Please pre-register your bike <A href="index.htm">Here</A>
