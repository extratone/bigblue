<h2>Access:</h2>
Summer:<P>
Drive west on Highway 1 from Golden B.C. to the bridge over the 
Columbia River at Donald (sawmill). From the bridge, measure 21.2 km
west on Highway 1 to a logging road heading north, also signed "Big Lake
Fishing". Follow the logging road for approximately 59 km to 0.5 km
past the 111 km logging mileage post, just short of Swan Creek. Then 
turn left (west) off the main logging road. After about 1 km, keep right
at the junction and continue for a total of about 3 km from the main 
road. Park and proceed across the logged area and look for cairns and/or
flagging where the trail leaves the lower right of the logged area. You are
now where Swan Creek Valley starts to close in. Follow the trail up the
valley. The hut is NOT in the area marked "Fairy Meadow"! Do not pass
through the canyon to the bottom of the glacier, but stay high in the
trees to get well above the snout of the glacier and to gain the crest 
of the old lateral moraine on the south side. Follow the crest of the 
moraine. Eventually, the moraine top widens and becomes wooded, and
the narrow creek valley south of the moraine widens into a meadow. The 
hut is on a knoll about 400 m from the start of the meadow and 200 m
from the moraine crest. 5-6 hours.<P>
