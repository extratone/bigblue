Noradrenaline is a hormone that builds in anathlete's body after years of exposure to danger - like after paddlinga kayak every day for 20 years.  When noradrenaline kicks in, you feeleuphoric and centered even in the midst of great effort; you arepoised, controlled, and at peace.<p>Adrenaline, on the other hand, is the everyday stuff of danger andanxiety.  Adrenaline pumps when you're pushing your limits, or whenthe elements suddenly drop something in your path - like a boulder -that's beyond your control.<p> The combination of stress and bliss is the foundation ofalternative sports.<p> Welcome to Adrenaline.<p> We're opening shop with five sports - <ahref="../rapid/index.htm">Rapid</a> for river rafting, <ahref="../rock/index.htm">Rock</a> for rock climbing, <ahref="../disc/index.htm">Disc</a> for Ultimate Frisbee, <ahref="../crank/index.htm">Crank</a> for mountain biking, and <ahref="../surfboard/index.htm">Surf</a> for surfing. There are many more tocome.<p>We care about people who drop their boats over ledges and lay out for thedisc. People who overcome their fears and commit to increasing their skills. Weknow the <a href="../earth/adren.disclaimer.htm">risks</a>, but we still play.<p>We agree with Edward Abbey who wrote:<p><blockquote>A venturesome minority will always be eager to set offon their own and no obstacles should be placed in their path; let themtake risks, for Godsake, let them get lost, sun-burnt, stranded,drowned, eaten by bears, buried alive under avalanches ....<br> -<i>Desert Solitaire</i></blockquote><p><h2>The <a href="../earth/index.htm">Core</a></h2><p>The highest-quality information is often imparted by word-of-mouth.<p>Adrenaline moves by word-of-mouth onto the Web. In Core, we providethe basic information you need to play Adrenaline sports, but we'rejust getting started and we depend on you to help us fill in thegaps. Tell us how to boat a river that's running 100,000 cubic feetper second, where to find someone to throw a disc with, and where tograb a beer and pitch a tent so we'll never have to sleep in ouroverpacked cars again.<p> We hope you enjoy Adrenaline. Let it help you get to where you want to be.<p>- Caitlin G.
