Be careful, know your limits, and take responsibility for yourself.<p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/adrenaline/95/41/contrib/index.html#Thornburg"><img align=left src="https://archive.gyford.com/earth/images/disclaim.gif" border=0></a>Or, as our Director of Operations and lawyer-interface so eloquently puts it:<p>The information presented in this section is collected from a variety of sources and is provided for your general information and entertainment only.
