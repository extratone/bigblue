They use a matching set of miniaturechrome-plated planes designed by Fitch: a jet-engined pepper shaker and aprop-driven salt shaker. The 1-inch-high sculptures are too cool not to keep,and the airline knows it - the bottom of each shaker reads: Pinched from VirginAtlantic. Upper Class Salt Shaker and Pepper Pot: Free if you steal them. VirginAtlantic Airways: +1 (212) 242 1330.<h3><img src="stuff/desk.gif">The Petrified Desk</h3> Are desks a thing of thepast? The Fossil Faux Desk, designed by artist Marcia Stuermer looks like it'sstraight out of the Stone Age. But if you look closely, you'll see that alongwith the carvings of prehistoric fish, the desk has electronic componentsembedded into it. Look even more closely, and you'll discover the desk is actuallymade of hand-carved wood. Stone Age accessories: a stony bed, chair, lamp, andclock. Yabba dabba doo! Fossil Faux Desk: US$2,000. +1 (415) 861 1933.<h3><img src="stuff/puck.gif">Puckish Wrist Relief</h3> Using a padded restat the base of your keyboard is better than nothing, but the spongy slabencourages you to keep your wrists in the same place no matter where your fingersmay roam across the keyboard. PC Pucks were designed to go under your wrists andslide across the desk, thereby keeping your wrists in a neutral position whileyou type and operate the mouse. Not only will PC Pucks decrease the stress on thetendons in your wrists, they'll also give you groovy '70s-style air hockeyflashbacks. PC Puck: US$20 pair. Back Basics, Ltd.: +1 (201) 402 4968, fax +1(201) 377 7963.<h3><img src="stuff/hoopla.gif">Multimedia Hoopla on a Laptop</h3> Next timeyou make a multimedia presentation, leave the slide projector, video camera, andtransparency projector at home - bring the VID-P11 along instead. This Sony-builthydra has a video camera with a 10-power zoom, a backlight, adjustablefluorescent sidelights, video output, and an RS232C interface so you can controlthe whole show with your laptop. Now you just need to come up with a good idea toit show off. VID-P100 Presentation Stand: US$3,500. Sony: (800) 472 SONY.<pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../signal/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">37 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">21 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/fetish/95/43/index3a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
