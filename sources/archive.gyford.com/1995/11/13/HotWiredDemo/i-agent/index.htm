The Web is jammed with <ahref="index.htm">newspapers</a> and <ahref="index.htm">magazines</a> taking their paper-basedcontent and <i>repurposing</i> it. (That's the buzzword, I believe, for theonline equivalent of leftovers. Hang a few hundred words out there andgussy them up with Hypertext Helper and maybe people will eat it.)<p>Of course we won't eat it. What are we, stupid?</dl></dl><pre></pre><p align=center><img src="stuff/waynew.a.gif" alt="The Birth of Way New Journalism"><h3><p align=center>By Joshua Quittner</h3><pre></pre><dl><dl><dd>Well, <a href="index.htm">Big Media</a> isn't stupid either. Why do you think It's here?<p>Nearly two-thirds of the cost of putting out a newspaper or magazineis the cost of printing it (paper, ink, printing presses) anddistributing it (trucks, delivery folks, mail). Uncouple the contentfrom the production and distribution costs, and you see the kind ofcash we're dealing with here. Introduce the possibility that by theend of the decade, 100 million people will be on the Net. Now, givethose people the <ahref="index.htm">technicalability to pay</a> 3 cents for each and every story they read. If only1 million people read, say, one <i>Time</i> story on O.J. Simpson, that'sUS$30,000. Pretty soon, you're talking about real money.<p>Right now writers need Big Media because Big Media owns the means ofdistribution. But as soon as a standard for exchanging trivial sums ofmoney is adopted on the Net, it will turn the tables on thatequation, and Big Media will need writers. It becomes cheap to be amass-market publisher, right? So if the financial terms of therelationship are unsatisfying, writers can publish their own Websites, presumably taking readers with them. The news gatherers/storytellers with marketable points of view can dictate the terms for <ahref="index.htm">publishing their spin</a>on the world.<p>But the change I'm talking about has nothing to do with makingmoney. Indeed, the change I'm talking about is much bigger thanmoney. I'm talking about a sea change in journalism itself, in theway we do the work of <a href="index.htm">reporting</a> and presenting information. The changethat's coming will be more significant than anything we've seen sincethe birth of New Journalism; it may be even more revolutionarythan that. It has to be: Look at all the new <a href="index.htm">tools</a> we're getting.<p><a name = "digression1"></a>Tom Wolfe's article, "<ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/i-agent/new.html">The Birth of 'The New Journalism'</a>" smashed theconventional notion of reportage. If you aspired to The Calling, youhad to read this piece; it's taught in most journalism schools to thisday. Wolfe pointed out that it was OK to have fun with facts (as longas the writer had mastered the material). It was good to speak with avoice (as long as the writer wasn't too much of a dork). It wasimportant to take risks and experiment (as long as there was atangible payoff for the reader).<p>But Wolfe and company had a relatively small tool chest toloot. Imagine what those new journalists could have done with <a href="index.htm">video</a>and <a href="index.htm">sound</a>, with hypertext links and limitless bandwidth. Yes, ajournalism that uses the best devices of the novel - and the movie!and the radio! and the CD-ROM! and networked communications! - to tellstories.<p><a name="digression2"></a>We're not just going to change that art, but evolve it - you understand - take it to the next plane: The <ahref="index.htm">Way</a> New Journalism.<p>So where are the Way New Journalists? They're out there hackingaround, testingthe tools, looking for ways to use this radical change intechnology to improve storytelling. You can see it on theWeb. Already, there are things that work, and things that don't. Mostof these sites have nothing to do with journalism; but then again,neither did the novel.<pre></pre><img src="stuff/a.few.sub.gif" alt="A Few Things That Should Work in the Way New Journalism:"><p><Dl><dd><b>The element of surprise:</b> I titter as Netscape paints 10 newimages on my screen. It's like headlines in three dimensions:Something <a href="index.htm">catches my eye</a> andtricks me into looking for more. Something <ahref="index.htm">lures</a>me into interacting and tunneling deeper for information. Point,click, and open a jack-in-the-box that tells you something you didn'talready know.<p><dd><b>Sudden narrative:</b> Face it - until we have flexibleflat panels with brilliant, high-definition displays, reading on thescreen sucks. Sudden narrative to the rescue: Tell me a <ahref="index.htm">dramaticstory</a> in, say, 250 words - a screenful of text. This is animportant device, too, because <ahref="index.htm">brevity</a>will be an antidote to the Net's information overload.<p><dd><b>Voice:</b> Voice becomes more intimate and immediateonline. You expect your reporter (or your newspaper/magazine) to be anintelligent agent, a voice you recognize and trust. Since,theoretically at least, our email addresses will be part of ourbylines, you'll be able to <a href="mailto:quit@interramp.com">flameaway</a> at the reporter. This means the piece of reportage will existin an organic state, with an evolving factual base. Small errors willbe unacceptable because they can be so easily corrected. You'll also "<ahref="index.htm">know</a>" your reporterbetter.<p><dd><b>Hypertext links:</b> <ahref="index.htm">Go as deepor stay as shallow</a> as you want within a piece.  Start with aheadline version of a story and link deeper. Hell, you can click rightback into the archives and put any event into historicalperspective. But hypertext can also be a curse because journalists mightuse it to avoid doing their jobs (the job of filtering all thatinformation into an all-you-need-to-know, ready-to-eat package). Theproblem with hypertext links is, where's the closure? I want my newsfast and furious; I don't want to be <ahref="index.htm">surfing</a> around forthree hours, only to end up dazed and confused and disintermediated ata <ahref="index.htm">WhiteHouse press-briefing site</a>.<p><dd><b>Instant reaction/The Big Talk Show in the Sky:</b> No more ofthat Man on the Street crap. You can build reaction right into a storyby linking to the appropriate <a href="news:alt.journalism">Usenetforum</a>, <a href="index.htm">IRC</a> channel, or<a href="index.htm">MOO</a>. You cantalk about this story by joining the <a href="../threads/index.htm">thread</a> already in progress - or start your own.Don't underestimate this device. I learn best by reading,but talking about information with someone else is an equallyefficient way to absorb data.</dl><pre></pre>I suspect that the people who figure out how best to use the tools ofthe Net for journalism will be the people with nothing to lose. Whichis to say, kids, students, the disenfranchised. The Wolfes and theBreslins are out there. They have a medium but no platform ... yet.<p>I teach a class at Columbia University's Graduate School ofJournalism. We use the Internet to find news stories. Soon, we'll bepublishing our stuff on a <ahref="index.htm">Web site</a>. I told thestudents that we're starting from scratch; we have no content torepurpose. We just have a Web site, our own computer geek who cantweak HTML like it's his native tongue, and empty space that extendsinfinitely. How do we fill it? What works? Will anything work?<p>"Do we have to use the page as a metaphor? Can a page be an oval or a circle instead of a rectangle?" one student asked.<p>I'll let you know when we find an answer.<pre></pre></dl></dl></dl><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><p><a href="../signal/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a> <a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/progbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">8 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">28 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
