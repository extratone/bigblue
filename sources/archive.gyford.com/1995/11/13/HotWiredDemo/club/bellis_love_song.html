...I should have been a pair of ragged shortsspiraling around at the bottom of the pool.*     *     *     *     *And the afternoon, the evening, sleep so peacefully!Smoothed by somebody's fingers,Asleep... tired... or it malingers,Stretched out here between us on the waterbed.Should I, after the Dress to Get Fucked Party,Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?But though I have puked and passed out, puked and prayed,Though I have seen my head [hair a fucking mess] brought in upon a platter,I am no prophet-- and here's no big deal;I have seen the fire of my lust flicker,And I have seen the bitch at the coat check hold my coat and snicker,And in short, I was totally paranoid.And would it have been worth it, after all, After college, serial murder, and L.A.,Among the corpses, among talk of death today,Would it have been worthwhile,To have bitten the matter off with a smile,To have squeezed half a gram into a ballTo roll it toward some overwhelming question,To say: "I'm that dude from the Bible, come back from the dead,Come down off the drugs to tell you, tell you all."If one, settling a pillow by her head,      Should say: "Clay, that is, like, so totally wrong,     Like, totally, totally wrong."And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worthwhile,After the sunsets and the graveyards and the bum-sprinkled streets,After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail,     along the floor--And this, and so much more?--It is too totally hard to say what I mean!But as if the coke threw my nerves in patterns on a screen:Would it have been worthwhileIf one, settling from eating or puking on the wall,And turning towards the window should say:     "Like, totally totally wrong,     Clay, that is so totally wrong."*     *     *     *     *No, I'm not that guy out of Shakespeare, and I shouldn't be:I'm some hanger-on, one that will doTo swell a belly, start a line or two,Advise the prince, no doubt a stupid fool,Submissive, glad to be of use,Quiet, careful, and with a really really good dealer,Owning snuff-flicks, into self-abuse,At times, indeed, almost weirder, realer-Almost, at times, a total fucking idiot.I grow old... I grow old... And I realize that everyone here thinks that I look like shit.Shall I comb my hair forward?  Do I dare to eat the bitch?I shall wear something simple, like Perry Ellis, and walk upon the beach.I have heard the mermaids singing when I've had way too much Ex.I didn't think that they would sing for me.I watched them mainlining heroin, smoking pot,Impassively, as they destroyed themselves, I soughtTo save one.  I was successful... not.I have tried to pull you out of the pitwhere you were on drugs, caked in shit,and I failed, I failed: the title "hero" doesn't fit.</PRE>
