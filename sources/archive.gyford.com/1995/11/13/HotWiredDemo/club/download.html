A folder,cleverly called Toolkit, will be transferred to your local hard drive. Thisfolder contains all the HTML files and images that comprise theWebomatic. However, these files have been compressed for easy transfer, andyou may need to uncompress them manually.<p>To use the Webomatic locally, just find the Open File command on yourbrowser's menu bar, and locate the file called index.html, which isincluded in the Toolkit folder.<p>If you want to get fancy, you can even customize your toolkit bymodifying the HTML files. Add your favorite links; remove the ones youhate; paint your initials on the toolbox lid. Make the Webomatic yourown.</h3><pre></pre><p align=center><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/club/toolkit.hqx">Macintosh</a><p align=center><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/club/toolkit.tar">NEXTSTEP</a><p align=center><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/club/toolkit.zip">OS/2</a><p align=center><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/club/toolkit.zip">Windows</a><p align=center><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/club/toolkit.tar">X Windows System</a><pre></pre><p align=center><a href="toolkit.menue.html"><img align=middle src="stuff/toolbox.back.gif" border=0></a></body></html>
