And unlike the chat areas on some commercialonline services, there are no chaperons here.<p>Club Wired takes place inside a telnet window that pops up while youare in HotWired. This window provides a constant stream of thereal-time dialog between our members and guests.<p>When the telnet window first pops up, you'll be asked to type in yourHotWired member name and your HotWired password.<p>Need telnet software? Grab it from our <ahref="toolkit.htm">Toolkit</a>, in the helperapplications section for your platform.<p>If you've never visited Club Wired, please read the <ahref="chathelp.html">instructions</a>, or simply <ahref="index.htm">Enter Club Wired</a>. </h4><pre></pre><h3><pre>U P C O M I N G   E V E N T S</pre></h3><pre></pre><p><img align=left src="stuff/ellis.gif" alt="Bret Easton Ellis" width=55 height=75><b>Friday, 29 September<br> 1 p.m. PDT<br> Bret Easton Ellis, brat-pack novelist</b><pre></pre><!--new: This man gets a lot of crap: bad-boy brat-packer Bret EastonEllis joins Club Wired for a special appearance: Friday, 29 September1995 at 1:00 p.m. PDT (20:00 GMT).--><!--flash: Famed brat-packer Bret Easton Ellis: Club Wired, Friday--><!--teaser: Bret Easton Ellis: Club Wired, Friday--><p><ahref="bellis_love_song.html">BretEaston Ellis</a>, of late-'80s literary brat-pack notoriety, hasresonated controversy ever since his first novel, <cite>Less ThanZero</cite>, was published during his senior year at BenningtonCollege in 1985. Ellis went on to write <cite>American Psycho</cite> in1991, a scathing critique of nihilistic excess and eighties' greed,which focused further negative attention on the author - includingboycotts and death threats; threats, according to Ellis, like "beingraped with a nail-studded baseball bat. It was worse than a lot of thestuff in <cite>American Psycho</cite>." <cite><ahref="bellis_love_song.html">The Informers</a></cite> is Ellis'slatest book, described in his own words as "a kaleidoscopic andfractured view of Los Angeles in the early 80s," and it's every bit asviolent and depraved as his previous works. Bret Easton Ellis stopsby the HotWired office for a special Club Wired appearance onFriday, 29 September 1995 at 1:00 p.m. PDT (20:00 GMT).<pre></pre><p><img align=left src="stuff/mchugh.gif" alt="Maureen McHugh"><b>Tuesday, 3 October<br>6 p.m. PDT<br>Maureen McHugh, the future of intelligent sci-fi</b><br><!-- new: Head Space welcomes Maureen McHugh, an intelligent sci-fi life form, Tuesday. --><!-- flash: Maureen McHugh'saward-winninggay sci-fi pulp,Tuesday. --><!--teaser: Maureen McHugh, The Future of Intelligent Sci-Fi, Tuesday--><pre></pre><a href="bellis_love_song.html">Maureen McHugh</a>'s<a href="bellis_love_song.html"><cite>ChinaMountain Zhang</cite></a> presents a cyberpunk, futuresque view of gayissues, and was one of the most acclaimed d&eacute;buts of the '90s,winning the Locus First Novel Award, the <ahref="bellis_love_song.html">TiptreeAward</a>, and the Lambda Literary Award.

As frontwoman, composer, and headmusician of the band Master/Slave Relationship, she has explored allmanners of fetish and <ahref="bellis_love_song.html">S/M</a>fantasies over a decade's worth of indie cassettes and CDs. Unlikemost of the mainstream fetish products, M/SR releases are designedneither to titillate nor to make you feel safe. Jaffe writes aboutdominance and submission from inside the aesthetic. Her lyrics andimages are about genuine desire - something that is never safe. Jaffeis also unafraid of her tools, not intimidated bytechnology. Recently, she designed and released the CD-ROM, <i>SmutPicture Racket</i>, a 10-year retrospective of her work with M/SR. Notonly is this one of the few authentically erotic CD-ROMs available,but its lush graphics and hidden levels of images and sound make ita technical breakthrough for a homebrew product.  Jaffe appears inRichard Kadrey's Covert Culture series forum, Wednesday, 4 October at6 p.m. PDT (01:00 GMT).<pre></pre><h3><pre><a href="transcri.html">T R A N S C R I P T S</a></pre></h3><b>Missed the event?
