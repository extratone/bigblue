It was part of a jukebox installation I was doing..<p><b>lachuga asks: It seems that "performance art" is notan easy field to make your living in.  How did you getstarted?

Do I con somefriends into letting me perform in their space? Do I hopesome crazy rich man decides Im cute and gives me enough cashto get a show going?  all of the above? I mean, it seemsthat there aren't many people out there willing tocontribute to something that is considered "weird" andunconventional...</b><p>make sure you can make people laugh and don't be obscure& use your whole self & now we gotta take off so by from theKnitting Factory!
