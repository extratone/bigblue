Refers to the retractable armor covering     the Batmobile.Cyber Noir     Used to describe dark, trippy, weird "cyber" films and shows like Wild     Palms, Tank Girl, and VR.5.Gutter Tribes     Nomadic bands of homeless people in their teens and early twenties who     travel from city to city, making their living primarily through     panhandling.In the Plastic Closet     Said about someone who refuses to admit to having cosmetic surgery. "Is     Tori Spelling in the plastic closet, or what!?"Triple-dub     An abbreviated way to say "WWW" (double-yew, double-yew, double-yew)     when speaking a URL. "Hey, check out this cool Web site at triple-dub     dot neowobbly dot com."Value-Subtracted Reseller     A company that buys components from other companies and puts them     together in a system that's less than the sum of its parts. Opposite of     value-added reseller.Waitbuster     Checkout-counter displays that entice you to buy, buy, buy while you     wait. (Also called a "shelftalker.")- Gareth Branwyn (jargon@wired.com)Tip o' the tiara to: Jerry Dunn, Gavin Ivester, Kevin Kelly, Mikki Halpin,Michael Gold, Jef Poskanzer, and Marjorie Ingall.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Copyright © 1995 Wired Ventures Ltd.Compilation copyright © 1995 HotWired Ventures LLCAll rights reserved.
