What, then, is a child to do in today's world of ceaseless media images and corporate brands? Enter POGs. It all started with a child's game in the Hawaiian Islands. To promote its juices, an island beverage company printed whimsical characters on the tops of bottle caps (the name POG was derived from a drink flavor: passion fruit, orange, and guava). <P>When a grammar-school teacher devised a game of cap trading, a phenom was born. The rules were simple: pile some POGs face up, slam the stack with a heavier cap, give those falling face up to the slammer. The game combined skill, luck, and the thrill of winning and losing. It was marbles-meets-baseball-cards - with a bit of stamp collecting tossed in.<P>Before long, visiting surfers from the mainland exported the game to California, where it exploded into a bona fide US$60 million-a year-and-growing cultural craze, rivaling the Hula-Hoop, Nerf football, and Trivial Pursuit. POG specialty stores, collectors' markets, and competitions sprouted, and corporate honchos soon saw the branding potential of the inch-wide medium: today there are Sonic The Hedgehog and Madonna POGs. <P>Now with Frogs - notched POGs that can be flicked across the room with astonishing speed or combined, Lego-like, into various shapes - the form is mutating. What's next? The characters born of the POG craze may soon make the leap into multimedia: several companies are planning cartoon shows, CD-ROMs, and screen savers.<P>Caveat fliptor. <P><I>- John Battelle</I><P><p><hr><p><h6><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/wired/full.copyright.html">Copyright &copy; 1995 Wired Ventures Ltd.</a><br>Compilation copyright &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC<p>All rights reserved.</h6></BODY></HTML>
