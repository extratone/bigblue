Written in the late '30s, it records West's journeys to Yugoslavia. But her treks are merely the backdrop to an engrossing and educational ramble through Balkan history.<P>Set aside some time: this book is 1,081 pages long, and every page has at least six sentences you'll want to underline and memorize for their sheer brilliance. What an extraordinary writer! I've found myself glued to Black Lamb and Grey Falcon till my eyes are groaning.<P>One of the great classics of the 20th century, this is still extremely relevant. In fact, it has just been reissued by Penguin 20th Century Classics.<P>It's fascinating and frightening to see how many of the great and terrible moments in history had their genesis in this ever-simmering cauldron. Are we at another such moment, one wonders? <P><I>- Brian Eno</I><P>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: US$20.

StarSight is a program-guide system that grabs program information hidden in your local public TV station's signal and displays it on command.<P>The StarSight service is free for 30 days - to get you hooked. It will. It's about US$4 per month thereafter. The StarSight schedule shows what's on and what's coming up, on broadcast or cable, for seven days. Unlike printed program guides, it's also possible to program this one to show only the channels I want, in whatever order makes sense to me - and I can arrange to tape a show just by clicking on its screen listing. I can also browse programs by type (comedy, sports, movies, etc.) and subtype (comedy movie, sitcoms, or specials), or bring up a station lineup for the next few hours. <P>I especially love the little blurb that tells me which station I've channel surfed into, what show is on, and how much longer it will be on - even during commercials. Another click of the remote brings up additional detail, such as plot summaries and the names of the stars. It's like a cross between Microsoft Windows and a newspaper's TV page.<P>Decoders that read the StarSight signals and put them on your screen are available in a set-top box from Magnavox for use with your present TV and built into TV sets from Zenith, Mitsubishi, and, soon, Sony and RCA.<P>The merits of the 27-inch Zenith I tried didn't end with StarSight. The set's sound and picture were good: rich, deep colors, and the kind of black and white you see on movie screens. Without the StarSight service, the Zenith won't show you what programs to expect, but the guide can still be programmed to show the name of each station or network you tune in to along with the channel number. <P><i>- Ivan Berger</i><P>StarSight: US$4 per month.

If the reception's good, the picture is that good.<P>The surprisingly bright, clear picture can even be watched outdoors, if you position it to minimize reflections. Its flexible design with movable screen and antennae help. But it's really the broad viewing angle of the active-matrix thin-film-transistor screen that makes this possible; you get full brightness and contrast within about 30 degrees to either side of the screen's axis and a reasonable view from 60 degrees. When you're finished watching it, the Marantz folds like a clam shell, forming a tidy package about the size of a supermarket paperback.<P>The mini speaker's tinny audio is not in the same league as the picture, but the sound through earphones (not provided) is good. The set's earphone jack is monophonic, so hearing the sound in both ears requires stereo headphones and a $1.19 Radio Shack adapter (#274-368). <P>TV reception is good in New York City. In my suburb, 30 miles away, reception is good on channels 7 to 13 and the UHF band comes in fair to poor on the lower channels. If you're farther from broadcasting sources, you'll have to attach an external antenna. On my commuter train, VHF stations don't come in well until I am nearly in the city, but UHF stations come in clearly from the moment I get on board. In fact, this little Marantz picks up UHF channels better than any bigger portable I've tried.<P>The manual is a trifle murky on how to store TV channels for quick tuning. A more serious problem is that the set doesn't say which channel you're picking up, so you have to guess while you're setting up the numbers. Also, six AA batteries last only about two and a half hours and aren't rechargeable. But an AC adapter is supplied if you're near an outlet.<P>All in all, the LCD-410 is just a portable television. What makes it special is that it's very good - and very, very portable. <P><I>- Ivan Berger</I><P>Marantz LCD-410: US$799.

Do you long for a 3-D, six-axis motion, ultraviolent game experience? Before you get too cocky, plug in Descent. All true gamers have a healthy masochistic streak; Descent will put even the finest through their paces. <P>Its 30 levels can reduce even the steadiest to a weak-kneed, babbling fool. This is one game that lives up to its massive hype.<P>The story line, if you care, isn't entirely original. In a nutshell, you play an independent contractor hired by the Post-Terran Mining Corporation to take care of a little problem: some power-hungry aliens have invaded the company's sublunar mining network. In case you haven't guessed, the action centers around large-scale annihilation of anything and everything in the mine shafts. Your PiroGX craft flies willy-nilly through the underground passages, and you try not to vomit. Between the dry heaves, it's a good idea to fire off as many rounds as possible before mining robots - hacked by the aliens - lay you to waste.<P>Descent is an immersive experience. It sucks you in and totally screws with your senses. Traveling upward, downward, backward, forward, and sideways at inhuman speeds, you quickly abandon your balance and sense of well-being. But soon, moving upside down feels as good as right side up - liberation is at hand. Flying by the seat of your pants, snagging weapons and ammo, you frantically try to figure out where the hell you are.<P>On a reasonably fast 486 PC or better, performance is excellent. I didn't cough up anything, but I fell off my chair several times in one particularly involved session. Up to eight players can play on one of four different network modes (anarchy with robots for me, please), and modem and IHHD Net play is supported with fluid results.

Here's how the makers promote their video: "The only way to save mankind is to collapse the entire universe into itself, begin all over again, and witness the rebirth, awakening, and future of the human race." But an equally plausible pr&eacute;cis might be "bouncing balls join forces with a metallic tadpole man and take a trip through 32 nightmare future worlds."<P>During the generous nine-minute credit sequence, we learn that director Michael Boydstun has just spliced together animation tapes. With sources as varied as A Walk in Time through Georgia (produced for the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, in Atlanta) and The Fascinating World of Materials (sponsored by Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Co. of Seoul, Korea), the achievement is that this reediting makes any sense at all.<P>Some individual sequences are quite brilliant, especially the circular lightning effect by French-based ArSciMed and Yuji Furuta's spinning zoetrope. But as one cyberpunk-tunnel zoom slides into the next, you realize just how clich&eacute;d computer animation has become. Also disappointing are the animators' attempts to model human (and animal) movements accurately. (John Lasseter and the people at Pixar have very little to worry about.)<P>There may be good technical reasons for the animations' shortcomings, but there is no excuse for Thomas Dolby's throwaway soundtrack featuring notable astrophysicist Fiorella Terenzi's patronizing advice: "Go out to the desert and you might find a piece of a meteoroid or a piece of space." Still, this is easy to solve. Just turn down the volume and create your own ambient soundscape.

Neumann's Computer Related Risks. In this book, you'll learn about telephone network and Internet failures, plane crashes, electronic privacy violations, and even the occasional forged e-mail message. Poor technology implementations that can lead to such disasters are more common than you might think.<P>Some of the problems described arise from human error: Neumann details situations in which typos wrecked a space probe, caused a telephone system to collapse, and blew up a European chemical plant. Other disasters appear to have their roots in faulty hardware. But, in the final analysis, most are the result of fundamental design flaws and accidents just waiting to happen.<P>Neumann, of course, is the moderator of The Risks-Forum Digest, one of the most widely read special-interest groups on the Internet (<a href="mailto:risks-request@csl.sri.com ">risks-request@csl.sri.com </a>). <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/wired/1.6/departments/electrosphere/dean.disaster.html">(See "The Dean of Disaster," <I>Wired</I> 1.06, page 42.)</a> In Computer Related Risks, Neumann brings the best submissions to the book, organizes them by subject, and tries to analyze the repeated system failures that occur in our technological society.<P>Where Computer Related Risks falls short is in the analysis. Neumann fails to present a comprehensive theory of risks. He also repeats himself: doubtless, he simply didn't have enough time to finish the book and keep up with his duties as a principal scientist at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. <P>Time pressures, of course, are another risk that can lead to hazardous system failures.

For me, LaserCue is what personal technology is all about. This tiny, black, extremely scary-looking tube, which mounts on a pool cue like a scope, projects a solid-state laser through a collimating and line-generating lens. The effect? A bright laser beam down the axis of the cue, across the cue ball, and directly onto your target. The result? A better, tighter stroke and, ultimately, a better game as the amateur pool player learns to make the cue ball follow the projected line directly to the target. <P>The beam reveals any unwanted lateral moves during drawback, forward-thrust, and stroke. If the beam is wobbling around, so is the cue, and you won't strike the cue ball squarely; a steady beam means a smooth stroke.<P>Even with the slight difficulty in getting the clamp device mounted (a snug, slide-on scheme would work better), LaserCue is easily the coolest in-your-face gadgetry accouterment since the pearl-handled switchblade.

Several years ago, after hearing a National Public Radio segment about the bang-up marketing push behind Madonna's book Sex, a fed-up Menzel embarked on a project to counter the excesses of the penultimate Material Girl. His pet-peeve spawned Material World: A Global Family Portrait, a stunning photography book and documentary-style CD-ROM that looks at the homes and lives of statistically "average" families from around the globe. <P>Using numbers provided by United Nations and regional experts, Menzel and 16 of the world's foremost photographers tracked down families from 30 countries. After a photographer visited for a week, each family and its precious possessions were moved outdoors - onto manicured lawns, alleyways, dirt roads - and photographed.<P>The portraits are sometimes misleading, but accompanying stats don't deceive. In Western Samoa, for instance, a large, grinning family surrounded by lush papaya and palm trees is a picture of bliss. But the fine print tells me this paradise ranks Number One in the world for teen suicide. On another page, I find that the handsome people of Bhutan have an average life expectancy of only 49 years for women and 47 for men. And the US is Number One among First World nations in regular church attendance, but Number Three in murder rate! On a lighter note, peeking at a special section on "toilets of the world" erased my embarrassment at occasionally having to tell guests in my home to "jiggle the handle."<P>The Material World CD-ROM brings even greater life to the subject, echoing the book's same breathtaking photography, and adding spectacular video and elegantly integrated sound.

But World Art magazine, now available in the US, attempts to redress this. Its sophisticated but genial point of view is pertinent to mainstream audiences. Although its trim, square cover resembles that of another prominent art magazine, World Art succeeds on levels of readability and practicality where other publications simply baffle.<P>Art critics and theorists like Jean Baudrillard and the late Clement Greenberg can be wily when left to their own devices, but they come off as much more credible in World Art's straightforward interviews. By asking frank questions and forgoing impenetrable artspeak, the magazine's articles end up both intelligent and accessible. <P>World Art's editorial mission to critique the forces of the international art scene is borne out in investigative and somewhat political articles. Their "Murder, Money and Masterpieces" expos&eacute; on the Mafia's dealings in art is a piece of detective-style journalism that is alien to cultural publications; I hope to see more like it (though I must admit it lacked the truly seedy punch I'd hoped for).<P>Like other art mags, World Art is on the hunt for the Next Big Artist, but it also features stories on largely disregarded areas such as Cuba and Ukraine. And, most happily, World Art treats the marginalized areas of comic-book and digital art with the deference they deserve.<P>With this magazine, a gracious amount of aesthetic pleasure is reinfused into a realm rendered dreary by the pundits and polemicists.

You know who Lucky is? That's Steve Sando - Mr. Lucky himself.<P>Mr. Lucky is a sophisticated guy in the San Francisco Bay area who lives every hour of his day in pursuit of two things - the heppest music on the planet and the best booze he can lay his hands on. MisterLucky is a zine he publishes every month to hip us all to the latest and finest in suave music and debonair drinks. Apparently, he has no real life to speak of, but that's good for you and me, because by reading his right-on music and hootch reviews, we go straight to being cool and keep a real life to boot.<P>CDs really took a bite out of musical experimentation for most people. Who wants to take a chance when they cost 17 bucks a pop? That's where MisterLucky comes in. Sando flexes his lifetime's worth of record collecting and packs each issue with a good two dozen solid recommendations of what he calls "jazz-centric" music. Jazz-centric covers everything from early American jazz and bop to classic Brazilian music to blues to Keely Smith to basically everything that's too cool for just anyone to be up on. I know a fair amount about music, but I copped a load of serious CDs from leafing through a few MisterLuckys, and so far, I haven't bought one dud on Sando's picks. I'm usually of the view that anyone who calls himself a music critic should be pummeled with a tube sock full of dung, but Sando knows what he's talking about. Thirty bucks for a year of MisterLucky is money extremely well spent. And I've got to say, Sando's educated, witty, and downright friendly writing is a welcome relief from the usual bitter-loser-with-a-Kinko's-card mentality most zines seem to suffer from these days. <P>Written for those who would define the perfect state as "listening to great tunes while expensive and delicious alcohol drifts through your bloodstream," MisterLucky is the drinking person's guide to fine music. <P><I>- Corey Greenberg</i><P>MisterLucky: US$30 per year, $35 for foreign markets.

A larger exhibit recounts some of the military's most successful cryptographers: Native American "code talkers," whose tribal languages were unintelligible to the enemy.<P>In the back of the museum is a copy of a 2-foot wooden seal of the United States of America, allegedly carved by Soviet school children and given to US Ambassador Averell Harriman in 1946. The ambassador was so taken with the seal that he hung it in his office; six years later, a routine security sweep discovered a hidden microphone inside the wood that the Soviets had used to eavesdrop on the ambassador's conversations.<P>But the best exhibit at the museum is the collection of 13 German Enigma machines, the standard military cipher used by Hitler during World War II. Not only do the machines work, but you can use them to encrypt and decode secret messages. To try it yourself, set the code wheels to 10-10-10, type in your message, and watch it translate into an unintelligible jumble of letters.

From the moment you enter the game's tiny medieval town of Tirich, you're under attack. Even the more benign inhabitants - rats, snakes, and crawling wounded - follow you relentlessly. By the time you master the keypad controls, you will have suffered numerous indignities - but it's a fairly enjoyable way of coming to terms with the inevitability of death. And once the adrenaline settles, you'll be well on your way to rescuing Tirich from its curse. It seems that the wizard's maid went messing with a book of magic and ended up trapping the town in her demonic dreams.<P>Ecstatica's more twisted aspects are not immediately apparent; the strangest scenes are deep inside. The setting is familiar - dragons, minotaurs, and wizards. But the vivid "ellipsoid" graphics give new edge to the sword and sorcery, lending characters more natural appearances and movements. Full of macabre touches, ominous music, and lurid as a child's nightmare, Ecstatica manages to be not only funny ha-ha, but funny weird.<P>Small-scale but well-proportioned, Ecstatica was devloped by Andrew Spencer, and bears the hallmark of a finely warped mind rather than a production line - more evidence that the best bizarre computer products are the result of traditional authorship. <P><I>- Marc Laidlaw</I><P>Ecstatica, DOS CD-ROM: US$59.99.

A dress-up parade and the trapeze seem to appeal to children who like fantasy and role-playing, while the human cannonball and lion acts draw those who enjoy making judgments about spatial relationships and playing in competition.<P>It's easy to make trapeze artists miss each other in midair or accidentally shoot cannonball clowns out of the tent. But if a child doesn't fully figure out an act, he or she never truly gets stuck - after a while, the routine gently concludes.<P>A separate environment, the Music Tent, offers interactive music numbers that succeed in their own simple way, better than most interactive music CD-ROMs for adults. And a clever mousehole whisks you from place to place so you never have to laboriously retrace your steps.<P>Traditional animation techniques and character voices by Ayshe Farman-Farmaian and team are superb, but the original songs may echo through your head for longer than you'd wish. Circus! offers a gentle alternative to the obsessive level-hopping that dominates interactive games for children. <P><I>- Jim Gasperini</I><P>Circus!: US$39.95, Mac and PC.

Three artists' interactive work appear in artintact 1, the first issue of Artists' Interactive CD ROMagazine from ZKM, a multifaceted institute in Karlsruhe, Germany, that has ambitions to be the Bauhaus of the digital age.<P>Simplest in structure is "Manuskript" by Eric Lanz. What at first look like hieroglyphs become, on closer inspection, rows of tools - from salad forks to industrial saws to toilet plungers. The minimalist structure is an ironic commentary on taxonomic categorizations. Click on each tool and start a short video showing it in action. What's that? Oh, a ring sizer. The guessing game is surprisingly engaging, but ultimately a bit thin.<P>More complex is "The Exquisite Mechanism of Shivers" by American artist Bill Seaman. Thirty-three sentences are broken into remixable groups of phrases, so you can produce absurdly poetic lines like "An ephemeral certainty triggers an enigmatic arrangement to escape the changing ramifications of a resonant desire." Videoclips associated with each phrase (panning landscapes, close-ups of machinery) allow sentences to be played as movies. There is an unfortunate pause between clips on generated sentences, though the 33 original sentences play more smoothly. The curious associations produced by jumbling video, sound, and text create an endless multimedia update of the Dadaist game "Exquisite Corpse."<P>Most elaborate is French artist Jean-Louis Boissier's "Flora Petrinsularis," based on Jean-Jacques Rousseau's homonymous book about flowers and his famous Confessions. Rousseau's memories of 16 amorous encounters are dramatized in pairs of short looping video animations, mainly voyeuristic close-ups of fetish objects (a bit of lace slipping off a breast, a pink sash coming untied) and faces (a tear running down a cheek, a seductive off-shoulder glance). Sixteen varieties of flowers get parallel treatment. Often, the paired clips show the same scene with a slight gap in time, to uncanny effect.<P>The disc comes embedded in a handsomely designed book containing learned commentary on the works in English and German. These three pieces, which all began as installations, have been reworked into delicate little gems. Such intellectual meditations on the nature of seeing and interactivity won't be to everyone's taste, but at least you'll have something to show when the downtown crowd comes to visit. <P><i>- Jim Gasperini</i><P>artintact 1: US$49.95 Mac CD-ROM.

She wanted my Commodore 128. I swallowed hard. My 128 had helped me create extra-wide margins on more term papers than I could count, and my brother and I cemented our relationship playing Blue Max and 4th and Inches. No matter. After much gnashing of teeth, my mother declared that I was too sentimental and sold the machine for 50 bucks. So, when I stumbled across the zine Historically Brewed a few months later, I could relate to its devotion to outdated technology. <P>Historically Brewed caters to serious collectors of displaced workstations and microcomputers, appealing to both the geek and the pack rat in us all. Although its prose does get a bit thick with data and dimensions, it provides a refreshing change to the constant prattle about upgrades in other computer mags. An article in Issue 7 details the rise (the fall comes in a later installment) of Digital Equipment Corporation's Programmed Data Processor (PDP-8), an early minicomputer deemed wildly successful after Digital sold 1,200 of them during the late '60s. Then came the PDP-8/S, the first cash-and-carry desktop computer, which spawned clones galore and eventually led to the PC revolution. <P>What saves Historically Brewed from being just another boring computer-history journal is its audience. The letters page is a great read, if only because it's nice to know there are others - in this case, college professors and retired technicians - who believe that the sum of a computer is greater than 0 and 1. There's the usual feisty but good-natured dissent as well. One reader argues that the Macintosh Model 0001 (available for US$500 in the Trading Post) pushed "interface fascism" because it didn't have cursor keys, forcing you to handle the mouse; another relates that many reporters at small Kentucky newspapers still swear by their Tandy 100s, forcing newsrooms to use only 300-baud modems as a result. <P>And my mother thought I was too sentimental! <P><I>- Chip Rowe</I> <P>Historically Brewed: US$3 an issue, or $18 for six bimonthly issues. +1 (904) 384 7163, e-mail: <a href=mailto:historical@aol.com>historical@aol.com</A>.<P><HR><P><!--subsect 12-Step Reengineering subsect--><h2>12-Step Reengineering </h2><P>The widespread practice of reengineering long-established business processes from scratch, usually with the aid of information technology, has probably wrecked more lives than any business fashion since the reign of the numbers-oriented financial whiz-kids of the '50s. Even reengineering's best-known prophets will remind you that most reengineering projects fail. One problem is that these prophets have offered little concrete guidance for would-be reengineers. Daniel Petrozzo and John Stepper's Successful Reengineering promises to change this by providing step-by-step instructions. <P>Most people will find this book useful only as a cultural artifact from the strange world of industrial automation. It presumes that you're up-to-date on the jargon and debates of that world, and it makes no pretense of drawing the stuff together in a coherent conceptual framework. <P>What the authors do provide is a batch of small details that nobody could make up without having been there, such as the danger of conflict among partisans of various software-development tools. They also insist that every reengineering team needs a public relations manager to spread the gospel and quell dissent.<P>Yet beneath this, Petrozzo and Stepper's book shows that the whole idea of reengineering is not a new one. Core ideas for mapping and redesigning work processes are essentially what systems analysts started doing decades ago: treating organizations as assembly lines, people as component parts of a machine, and themselves as the minds behind the One Best Way to arrange work organizations. Their methods presume that we live in a <I>Wired</I> world where everyone has a computer and access to the Net, but they exhibit no concept of the power of putting people online. <P>The world presented by Petrozzo and Stepper has little room for change, little use for empowerment, and little respect for the capacity of intelligent people to organize their work for themselves. We can do better than that, and we can do it without the mayhem that reengineering so routinely brings to people's lives. <P><I>- Phil Agre</I><P>Successful Reengineering, by Daniel P.

Caught between hype and hope, they continue the hunt for that elusive piece of equipment that, manufacturers insist, will make their sound cooler and their demo tapes irresistible. While no piece of gear will ever win the creatively challenged million-dollar record deals, Yamaha's ProMix 01 is one of the most useful music tools since four-track analog recorders. If you've got the ideas and roughly 2,000 bucks, no other mixer will get your music to disk or tape - or to the house PA system - with so much value and convenience.<P>First, value. This 16-channel machine (plus an additional stereo input) comes with three stereo-dynamics processors for applications like compressing, gating, limiting, and ducking. Musicians will delight to find there are also two internal stereo multieffects processors for a variety of delightful reverbs, echoes, pitch shifting, and chorusing effects. Having internal effects and gates means that your audio data stays in the digital realm, and that patching is a breeze.<P>Second, convenience. The ProMix has motorized faders that allow for automated mixing. You can store your fader positions and effects settings into "mix scenes," making mixing simpler and more precise. Anyone who's ever tried to do a complicated mix with just two hands can now put them together and clap enthusiastically; automated mixing used to be a feature found only on consoles many times the ProMix's price.<P>Want more, gear nut? Get this. Fully parametric 3-band equalizer Phantom power. Four auxiliary sends; two for internal use, two for external. A digital two-track out. Full MIDI control.<P>So, no gripes, right? Not so fast. The headphone jack is in a truly asinine, hard-to-reach place. The unit stank up my home studio for a couple of weeks with a foul, synthetic smell. And the rack ears for the machine are optional and difficult to find.<P>Still, this is a sweet deal. With prices dropping for hard-disk-based recording systems and modular, digital eight-tracks, the gap between home recording and the professional studio - once the size of the Grand Canyon - will soon be measured in mere inches. <P><I>- Rogier van Bakel</I><P>Yamaha ProMix 01: US$1,999.
