But Blackstone had something the Net still does not - Mrs. Hawthorne, Blackstone's former librarian. A plump, stern woman, Mrs. Hawthorne spent much of her day shushing noisy kids or exiling boisterous bullies to remote corners of the reading room. But when it came to reference material, if I needed to find anything, I'd corner her. Within minutes, the book would be in my hands.<P>Mrs. Hawthorne retired last year, and I miss her, especially after fruitless hours of online fact hunting. Seems the Net has it backward: go online, and you can make all the noise you want, but it's almost impossible to find anything.<P>You can imagine my reaction when I heard about the Internet Public Library. It sounded like the answer to all my researching prayers. Who could resist the promise of an online reference desk? The instructions invited me to leave a question and assured me that a trained professional would e-mail me a partial answer, along with pointers to even more details. I instantly memorized the URL.<P>The system worked, though not very quickly. It took two days to get a full explanation of the differences between RISC and CISC processors, so it's likely the library won't be much use in settling barroom arguments. At least not until they get a lot more librarians. Right now, the reference desk is covered by 35 students at the University of Michigan School of Information and Library Studies -  a pittance compared with the droves of online info-hounds.<P>The Internet Library was dreamed up by Assistant Professor Joseph Janes in a moment of desperation. "I was scheduled to teach a seminar on the impact of technology, which I'd taught twice before. I wasn't sure I could face it again," Janes recalls. To stave off death by ennui, Janes proposed the Internet Public Library as a class project. Fifty-five students applied - far more than he'd expected. "At the beginning, I always felt the IPL was some kind of Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney movie - 'Hey, let's put on a library! I've got some costumes in the barn!'"<P>The library home page took about 26,000 hits in its first two weeks, mostly from visitors to the reference desk. But, says Janes, it's just a matter of time before net-surfing parents discover the library's youth division. There, you can download entire childrens books, complete with original illustrations and audio narration.<P>As a student-run operation, online library's well-being is at the mercy of graduations and summer breaks. So, Janes is trolling for sponsors to fund the library permanently. But Macphile Janes won't take just anybody's money. "I don't want to become the Microsoft Internet Public Library," he said. "But I could live with being the Apple Internet Public Library."<P>To speed up service and beef up staff, Janes is also looking for volunteer librarians willing to work the reference desk. About 60 have responded thus far, some from locales as far away as Australia. (Alas, still no word from Mrs. Hawthorne.)<P>Web reference hounds should point their browsers to <A HREF="http://ipl.sils.umich.edu">http://ipl.sils.umich.edu</A>.

In support of Quicktime technology for Mac and Windows, Continuum's banks hold a brimming stream of resources: sample code, Quicktime architecture, and codecs are among the topics discussed, while a press-release index and the latest news on Quicktime VR is a tantalizing source of pleasure for any multimedia junkie.

Dash to <A HREF="http://www.expanse.com/aflux/index.html">http://www.expanse.com/aflux/index.html</A> and catch up with the angular, amoral Aeon Flux, star of many a Liquid Television MTV short. Her cyber hide-out offers character sketches, interviews, and news about the next series coming this fall.<P>Another interesting inclusion is the original Aeon Flux plot synopsis, as pitched to MTV by its creator Peter Chung, which pushes Hollywood action-film conventions back at us "in the form of absurd heroic entertainment." (And you thought Batman was a problematic superhero....) Related links devout Fluxers will covet include one about French painter Egon Schiele, whose lithe, agonizing figures inspired Chung's animation style. Parlez-vous anim&eacute;?

Your social life? Are you questioning the troubling nature of existence itself? Judging by the postings on the Usenet newsgroup alt.angst, you're not alone.<P>Alt.angst doesn't propose any remedies for what the group's FAQ calls "the notion that life is essentially pointless and absurd," but it does offer commiseration in the form of postings from the existentially challenged. The group's posters have identified units of Angst ("angstroms" - even more effective if said with a thick, German accent), as well as Angst-producing agents ("angstogens").<P>But be warned: smiling emoticons are not tolerated, and uplifting posts are punishable by flames from the angst.cops. (It should come as no surprise that the denizens of alt.angst can be contentious.) "If you have to ask why humans are mean and nasty," explains their FAQ, "you probably don't belong here."<P><HR><P><!--subsect Burma: At Least Virtually Free subsect--><h2>Burma: At Least Virtually Free</h2><P>Free Burma is not your run-of-the-mill online tourist site picturing happy natives in quaint costumes. It is a portrait of a country held hostage by a repressive military r&eacute;gime. A lush land, once the "rice bowl of Asia," Burma (now called Myanmar) is now listed among the poorest countries of the world.<P>Ruled by General Ne Win, a heartless dictator who seized power in 1962, the people of Burma have remained oppressed by his brutal reign of terror. The country's popularly acknowledged democratic leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been imprisoned since 1989.<P>Free Burma contains up-to-the-minute news bulletins covering Burmese liberation efforts, an album of photos and sound clips about the country's culture, and a collection of interviews documenting the human-rights abuses that have become part of daily life in Burma. But most important, the site suggests more than a dozen actions you can take to help improve the situation in Burma, from writing the UN to heading off into the jungle yourself. Free Burma has succeeded in pooling information from a variety of sources, including The Carter Center, Amnesty International, and several Burmese activist groups. You can access Free Burma at <A HREF="http://199.172.178.200/freebrma/freebrma.html">http://199.172.178.200/freebrma/freebrma.html</A>.<P><HR><P><!--subsect Red, Red Wine subsect--><h2>Red, Red Wine</h2>Incessant rains and subsequent flooding have put a big damper on many a Californian's travel plans to the Napa and Sonoma vineyards this year. But parched and sullen surfers will find a buttery oasis at Master Sommelier Peter Granoff's Virtual Vineyards, a treasure-trove of fine wine and bubbly selections. When Peter's not recommending wines to his thirsty diners at Square One in San Francisco, he's tasting fine vintages from around the world and expressing his verdicts on Virtual Vineyards. His choice picks - many from small, lesser-known vintners - are handily accompanied by a comparison tasting chart of each wine's characteristics (flavor, body, acidity, tannin, oak, complexity, and level of dryness or sweetness), as well as recommended food pairings. For a real taste, give him your credit-card number, and you can even have a bottle delivered to your doorstep (via snail mail, of course).
