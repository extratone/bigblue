The first portable typewriter to offer interchangeable fonts, the "Blick" also boasted inventor George Blickensderfer's proprietary "scientific" keyboard layout, his "improvement" over the QWERTY layout. (Upon request, you could get the QWERTY design, but you first had to sign a release stating you'd been warned that QWERTY was inefficient.) You can buy your very own beautifully restored Blick - and other steampunk office equipment - from This Olde Office. Blickensderfer typewriter: US$595.
