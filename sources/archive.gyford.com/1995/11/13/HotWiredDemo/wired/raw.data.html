Not surprisingly, the higher the household's income, the more likely it is to be connected. Yet even when income is constant, black and Hispanic homes are less likely to have telephone service.<P><B>Embedded Processors</B><P>For every microprocessor installed inside a computer, three other 16- or 32-bit microprocessors are sold for embedded uses, such as controlling laser printers or cars. However, embedded processors must be sold at far smaller margins, so they usually reflect last year's state-of-the-art.<P><B>Monitors</B><P>Almost 80 percent of the computer monitors sold in 1992 were 14 inches across. But the release of Microsoft Windows, which quickly fills up screen real estate, has led to a rush on bigger monitors. Nevertheless, monitors that are larger than  17 inches are rare because of their price and bulkiness.<P><B>US Debit Terminals</B><P>Those who herald the coming of a cashless society cite the phenomenal growth of debit terminals. Last year, the number of terminals that accept ATM-style bank cards doubled as the devices spread to smaller stores. The only cloud on the horizon is transaction charges.<P><i>-Steve G.
