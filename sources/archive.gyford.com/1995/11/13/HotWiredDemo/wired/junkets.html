Seriously, what does Denmark bring to mind? Vikings? It's just not '90s. What about Danish? A sticky pastry, right? But with the right PR you might think, Denmark - peaceful, picturesque, and not as pricey as Scandinavia proper! Composed of the Jutland peninsula and more than 400 islands, the country is a hauntingly beautiful world of Renaissance castles and quiet fishing villages, Viking legend and fairy tales. <P>The capital city of Copenhagen, located on the largest island, Zealand, has an even bigger image problem than Denmark, with no Eiffel Tower or other well-known icon. Nonetheless, this city of medieval churches and modern clubs will impress even the most jaded junketeers. <P>Wander the winding back streets of the inner city (Indre By) and stroll down the Str&oslash;get, a cobblestoned pedestrian boulevard lined with shops and cafes, stopping at Chokoland for a taste of the local licorice. (One lick is enough, however.) When your feet are fatigued, snag a seat in the sun at the Caf&eacute; Europa, on Amagertorv, and do a little low-tech surveillance of Copenhagen culture.<P>Further down the Str&oslash;get lies Tivoli Gardens, the grande dame of amusement parks, with its old wooden roller coaster and regular firework displays. More amused by art? Amble over to the The Museum of Decorative Art (Kunstindustrimuseet) on Bredgade to see their exhibition of 20th-century Danish furniture design. Modern art lovers should also make the hike to Humleb&aelig;k, to visit the Louisiana Museum, an impressive collection of modern art housed in a 19th-century villa by the sea.<P>When your stomach summons, dine a la Danish at the traditional Cap Horn. Take a slice of brown bread and pile that sm&oslash;rrebr&oslash;d high with marinated herring, liverwurst, meats, and cheese. For a light lunch or a cool Carlsberg in the inner city, choose Caf&eacute; Sommersko, a popular destination during the day and after dark. Or opt for Caf&eacute; Dan Turrell, a social spot packed with unstudious students in the evenings.<P>The Danes delight in jazz, or at least the cosmopolitan Copenhageners do. Stop by the Montmartre, the city's major jazz venue, or the Copenhagen Jazz House, a Cinderella jazz joint, which turns into a disco at midnight.<P>Though you won't find much rotten in the city of Copenhagen, take the train north to Helsing&oslash;r to visit Kronborg Slot, said to be the site of Hamlet's Elsinore Castle. Shakespeare never visited Kronborg, but that hasn't stunted the local Hamlet souvenir industry.<P>It's truly a trek, but anyone who's played with those colorful plastic bricks should visit Legoland Park, built with more than 38 million Legos, in Billund on the peninsula. <P>More than enough Denmark data? Just one final fact: early in the Nazi occupation, the Danes smuggled 7,000 Jews across the Baltic Sea to Sweden in one night, saving 93 percent of the Jewish population! Not many countries could pull that off. The truth is, they don't need an Eiffel Tower after all. <P><I>- Jessie Scanlon</I><P><HR><P><H3>August 16-20<BR>   ONE BBSCON; Tampa, Florida </H3>      <P>   The Online Networking Exposition and BBS Convention is the offline event of the online world.
