Youstand on the top, savoring the glory, as onlookers cheer.</b>You andyour partner toast each other with the bottle of <i>brut</i> tucked inyour <A href="index.htm">haulbag</A>. You feel like you've conquered evil, cleaned up all the <Ahref="index.htm">Superfund</A> sites, andnegotiated peace in the <A HREF="index.htm">Balkans</A>.<p>That's how I fantasized about topping out on Half Dome. When Ifinally did it, the reality was that I was exhausted, irritable,hungry, thirsty, and I looked like crap. I celebrated by taking off myshoes and socks (do you have any idea how bad polypropylene smellsafter three days?), and my partner and I wolfed the last of our salamiand water.<p>The tourists did, however, shower us with attention.<p>"How did you pee?"<p>"What did you do with your, uh, <a href="index.htm">business</a>?"<p>"Do you sleep on that rock?"<p>"How are you gonna get down?"<p>These are not stupid questions. I asked the same ones BBW (BeforeBig Wall). But once you've beaten, moaned, laughed, whimpered,yelped, whooped, inched, and prayed your way up 2,400 vertical feet ofgranite, such inquiries can seem trivial. Our wish list was moreimmediate: Food. Water. Food. Showers. Food.  Clean underwear.<p>Half Dome's Regular Northwest Face isn't a difficult climb, aswalls go. The first climbers to top the Northwest Face, almost 40years ago, were Royal Robbins, Jerry Gallwas, and Mike Sherrick. Butit's still a <i>wall</i> - big and unforgiving.<p>I've been rock climbing for six years, and can hold my own on mostsport crags and free multipitch routes. My partner Jeff, another BigWall virgin, is a longtime bike tour guide and solid crack climber. Weboth hankered for a Big Wall trophy.<p> We left <Ahref="index.htm">YosemiteValley</A> on a balmy August evening, the full moon rising. Two nightslater, we were nestled on the 11th pitch bivy, 1,000 feet off theground. It's cozy up there, even though the ledge is hardly wideenough for a sleeping pad. There was plenty of room, however, for theplethora of mice indulging in the trash left behind by ourpredecessors.<p> The next day offered some stellar climbing, and even betterscenery of sun-speckled Tenaya Canyon - a panoply of shimmeringgranite and cascading water.  The rest of the climb, I was reduced tosnarling and whimpering. The worst wasn't getting stuck in anoff-route squeeze chimney; it was when I finally managed to turn myhead, and caught Jeff trying to suppress hysteria at my predicament.<p> It was dark by the time we reached Big Sandy ledge. We didn't getenough food or rest, but sunrise on the third day was magnificent,creating perfect silhouettes of Half Dome and El Capitan far below inthe Valley.  <img align=right src="stuff/rock.image.gif">The ascentstarted beautifully, with long arching cracks called the zigzags. Iwas humming.  We could see tourists above us. The top seemedmaddeningly close.<p>By late afternoon, I wasn't humming any more. I heard Jeff talkingto some random tourist about Florida. "Shut up!" I wanted toyell. "You can chitchat after we get off this damn rock!"<p>When our haul bag got stuck for the millionth time, with darknessfalling, I found myself banging my helmet against the wall, andbargaining with the gods.  <i>Never again ... never....</i><p>We topped out at twilight, and momentarily basked in our summitvictory. We wanted to get down to solid ground fast. It wasn't until Ilooked back at Half Dome from the valley that I was jolted out of asurreal state of exhaustion. For three days I had been a speck in asea of granite; I had been part of a massive rock face.<p> Jeff and I drove home, indulging in calories, Ibuprofen, and theinevitable rehash. By the time we reached San Francisco, the fears andfrustrations had taken on epic proportions. Half Dome was all theadventure we'd bargained for: absolute angst, coupled with clearpoetry and a bit of comedy. In <i>retrospect</i>, that is.<br><img src="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/rock/stuff/spc.gif"width=300 height=1><br><br></table><pre></pre><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../adrenaline/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/channelbar1.gif"></a><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/programbar.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">2 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">7 links</A>.</H4><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
