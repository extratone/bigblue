Still, we can't imagine spending ourtwo weeks vacation spreading compost.

Physically disabled travelers will also find plenty of tips forgetting off the beaten track in Foehr's well-thought-out presentation, includingdetailed information on accommodation and getting around.

Ford, for example, is set tobegin selling a "glider" version of its 1996 Ranger truck - glider because itcomes fully loaded with everything <i>but</i> an engine and a gas tank. Thepickup - whose fossil-fuel version is already the most popular truck in NorthAmerica - can be bought only by qualified electric vehicle modifiers. After thesemiddlemen have installed an electric motor and charger, you'll be able to buy thefinished product. One caveat: it's not really suitable for the "Gun-control meansusing both hands" bumper-sticker set. Electric-ready Ford Ranger - availablesometime in the next year from Troy Design and Management, Troy, Michigan: +1(313) 537 3880. (In 1998, Ford itself will begin selling its own complete electricversion, the Ranger EV. It will sell for approximately US$30,000.)<pre></pre><h3><pre>S o l a r  I s  B a c k</pre></h3><img align=right src="stuff/powerboo.gif" width=209 height=111>Solar power never did outlast the hype - we're still burning coal and splittingatoms. But if you take your laptop along on trips, you can actually start relyingon the energy source that renews itself every morning. Really. The durable vinylcover of the lightweight Sun Runner Powerbook solar battery pack unzips to revealrows of silicon photoelectric cells - just like those cool collectors onsatellites - that allow your Mac to run continuously in sun or light shade. Theunit operates under adverse conditions too - Power Express spokesperson LloydMiddlekuff says even a couple of test bullet holes weren't enough to shut itdown. Good news for the extremely, uh, adventurous. Sun Runner Powerbook forMacintosh 100 through 180: US$189. For Mac 520, 540, and Duo: US$354. PowerExpress: (800) 769 3739 or +1 (415) 529 0133.<pre></pre><h3><pre>P o p   B o t t l e   P u l l o v e r</pre></h3><img align=right src="stuff/patagon.gif" width=166  height=123>Wear your trash on your sleeve in garments made from Wellman Inc.'s EcoSpunpolyester fleece. Every year the environmentally correct textile giant turns 2.65billion two-liter plastic pop bottles into 265 million pounds of fiber. Most ofthe bottles come from curbside recycling programs, saving space in landfills,conserving almost a million barrels of oil annually, and avoiding the productionof nearly half a million tons of toxic air emissions. Wow. Top-of-the-lineoutdoor outfitter Patagonia uses the recycled fiber in its coveted Synchillagarments (like the classic Snap-T). This pullover won't pill, comes in 12 colorcombinations, will keep you ultrawarm on the road or at home, and weighs a mere21 ounces. Let's see, that would be how many pop bottles? Snap-T, US$82.Patagonia: (800) 638 6464 or +1 (406) 587 3838.<p>By <a href="mailto: lwellman@well.com">Laurel Wellman</a><pre></pre><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="https://archive.gyford.com/world/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a><p><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">4 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">5 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/travelkit/95/44/index2a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
