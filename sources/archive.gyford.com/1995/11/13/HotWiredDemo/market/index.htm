Most recently, October 16th's <i>Business Week</i> warned,"People's willingness to engage in online transactions requires a perception ofsecurity." Conferences and symposiums are held almost weekly on the subject - Iknow, I just spoke at one in Washington, DC - and pretty much everywhere you goyou hear this constant mantra about how consumers supposedly won't shop onlineuntil credit card security is assured.<p>This is such bullpuckie!<p>I mean, consumers shell out more than US$57 billion a year - that's $57<i>billion</i> - to buy products from catalog firms. And they don't have anyproblem at all giving their credit card numbers to some $6-an-hour clerk at theother end of those insecure toll-free telephone lines.<p>And what about the millions of restaurant patrons who hand over their creditcards every day to some surly waiter who then disappears with it before returningwith a receipt to sign? Or the tens of millions of shoppers who gladly give theircredit cards to store clerks without a second thought?<p>In short, all this talk of credit card security  being a prerequisite toonline commerce is bogus - an excuse cooked up by Internet shopping concerns andthe media to try to explain why consumers still aren't buying much of anythingonline.<p>The real reason people aren't buying very much online yet is that there'snothing much to buy online that can't be bought more easily or less expensivelyand with better service in more familiar surroundings - i.e., in stores andcatalogs. There are a few product categories for which online shopping hasadvantages. These include flower delivery, since buyers can see arrangementsonline before choosing them, and wine, because shoppers can read detaileddescriptions of wine as they choose. But, outside of such specific groups ofproducts, where's the truly compelling, value-added reason to go online to shop?<p>The truth is, there isn't much of one yet. That's the real hurdle Net-shoppingentrepreneurs have to overcome. And no amount of cryptographic magic is going tobring consumers into those online malls until they can derive some major addedvalue by doing so.<p>Historically, every new sales channel has faced the same challenge. In theearly days of the catalog industry, for example, firms touted the convenience ofshopping from home but most consumers remained understandably hesitant to buyanything they couldn't see or touch first. What if they didn't like what theybought when it arrived?<p>So what did the catalog firms do? First, they offered consumers toll-freephone numbers to call, making the whole process even easier than mail (let alonehaving to traipse downtown to the department store). Then they offered returnspolicies that were equal or <ital>superior</ital> to those of stores. Andgradually, as consumers gained confidence in the quality of service, convenience,and reliability of this new channel, the catalog industry took off.<p>The same thing will happen to the Internet shopping industry only when peoplesee that they can save significant amounts of time or money or hassle by shoppingonline. And when they can, consumers won't care a whole lot whether their creditcard numbers are encrypted or not.<p>Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying encryption isn't a good idea - I'msimply saying that, with the exception of home banking, it's not all thatcritical to spurring consumer acceptance of this new commercial medium. Just likemerchants in real-world stores, tomorrow's online merchants will need to havetrusty credit card readers and "burglar alarms" on their virtual doors. Butpeople don't go to stores to check out the burglar alarms. They go to stores thateither offer products that can't be found elsewhere, or that offer them at betterprices and with better service than anywhere else.<p>It's that simple - so simple, in fact, that even an encryption expert canunderstand it. Which is exactly what happened during a panel discussion abouttransaction security at last week's Vanstar Washington Summit, attended by 100executives mostly from the reseller and OEM industries.<p>The discussion began calmly enough. Ray Kammer, deputy director of the <ahref="index.htm">National Institute of Standards andTechnology</a> spoke about the fed's key escrow plan. Doug Miller of the <ahref="index.htm">Software Publisher's Association</a> linkedtransaction security to his organization's commitment to copyright protection.And Ed Scheidt, CEO of the information security firm TECSEC, spoke about hiscryptography products.<p>Then I got up and opened my speech by quoting Intuit's CEO Scott Cook oncredit card security.<p>"A red herring," was what Cook told me. And that's what I told them. Andwithin a few minutes everyone in the room - including the panel of encryptionexperts - were nodding their heads in agreement. It was as if everyone knew thesecurity issue was basically irrelevant but were they just waiting for someone to givethem permission to admit it.<p>And so it goes. Last summer, the media "crisis" du jour that sent everyoneinto a frightened tizzy over the Internet was "<ahref="index.htm">cyberporn</a>." Nowit's credit card security. What's next?<pre></pre><dl><dl><dd><img align=left src="stuff/sig.yellow.small.gif" alt="David Kline"></blockquote><h5><pre>D a v i d   K l i n e<a href="mailto:dkline@well.com">d k l i n e @ w e l l . c o m</a></pre></h5><br clear="left"><pre></pre><img align=bottom src="stuff/book.gif"> Check out my new <a href="index.htm">book</a>!<pre></pre></dl></dl><blockquote><!-- start local exec --><p><a href="../signal/index.htm"><img border=0 src="stuff/chanbar1.gif"></a><p><!-- using program imagemap in /market/footer/mainbar_nonmember.map --><a href="index.htm"><img border=0 src="../images/nomembar.gif" border=0 alt="Overview" ISMAP></a><H4>T H R E A D S :<A HREF="../threads/index.htm">30 topics</A>, <A HREF="../threads/index.htm">4 links</A>.</H4><PRE></PRE><b>The permanent location of this page is<br><a href="index.htm">http://www.hotwired.com/market/95/43/index1a.html</a></b><h6><a href = "../copyrigh.htm">Copyright</a> &#169; 1995 HotWired Ventures LLC.
