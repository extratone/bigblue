Darn it, it's time for somebody<p>else to cash in, and what better way<p>than to claim that you invented the<p>whole kit and caboodle? According to<p>a press release from one Dr. Michael<p>Doyle and his <A href="index.htm">Eolas Technologies</A>, Dr.<p>Doyle "invented" a technology in 1993<p>called "Weblets," which sounds<p>suspiciously like <a href="index.htm">HotJava</a>'s applets.<p>If Doyle's patent application is<p>granted, the folks at Sun who brought<p>us Java could owe this savvy<p>entrepreneur a tidy sum for<p>retroactive "licensing." Of course,<p>nobody can comment on the patent<p>filing itself, which remains secret -<p>all we have to go on is a <A href="index.htm">press<p>release</A> from Eolas last week. At one<p>point, the Eolas press release claims<p>that "also covered is the use of any<p>algorithm which implements dynamic<p>bi-directional communications between<p>Web browsers and external<p>applications." This little comment<p>and the rest of the release, of<p>course, elicited peals of virtual<p>laughter from the Web developers<p>community on its house organ, the<p><A href="index.htm">www-talk</A> mailing list. "Shipping<p>around executable code has been part<p>of the plan for the Internet since<p>day one," one developer noted to us.<p><img src="stuff/flux_spacer.gif"><p>More peals of laughter could be heard<p>from those who listened to the<p>Internet-ignorant Dan Dorfman plug<p>the NASDAQ-traded stock of Camelot<p>Corporation last Thursday because of<p>its hot, hot new product, <A href="index.htm">Digiphone</A>.<p>Prior to Digiphone, it appears that<p>one of Camelot's most recent<p>corporate triumphs was to place a<p>subsidiary, Camelot Entertainment,<p>into chapter 7 bankruptcy. At least<p>one observer who knows about voice<p>applications for the Internet, <A href="index.htm">Jeff <p>Pulver</A>, saw the product fail<p>miserably at two investor roadshow<p>appearances and for three days<p>straight at the most recent PC Expo<p>in New York. When Pulver queried the<p>Digiphone representatives at PC Expo,<p>they blamed their product's failures<p>on the Internet service provider at<p>the event. "What I found really<p>strange about that remark," Pulver<p>tells us, "is I was able to telnet<p>into my host without any problems the<p>entire show." <p><img src="stuff/flux_spacer.gif"><p>If Windows 95 doesn't turn out to have<p>quite the market reach as its $200<p>million advertising campaign, Bill<p>might be pointing his finger at the<p>engineers who managed to turn an<p>operating system that's <I>almost</I> as<p>good as the Mac OS into a big, fat<p>memory hog. We're told that at one<p>major consumer-products company an<p>upgrade won't be in the offing<p>anytime soon. Three-fourths of its<p>50,000 installed PCs lack the RAM<p>requirements for Win95. Can we have<p>some chips and a resale license,<p>please? <p></h4><p><img src="stuff/flux_spacer.gif"><h4>By Ned Brainard<pre></pre><i>Have a tip for Flux?
