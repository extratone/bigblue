PSB will bring togethertop researchers from the North America, the Asian Pacific nations, Europeand around the world to exchange research results and address open issues inall aspects of computational biology.  Replacing and extending the lastthree years of Biotechnology Computing Tracks at the Hawaiian InternationalConference on System Sciences, PSB will provide a forum for the presentationof work in databases, algorithms, interfaces, visualization, modelling andother computational methods, as applied to biological problems, withemphasis on applications in data-rich areas of molecular biology. <H2> Topics </H2> To provide focus for the very broad area of biologicalcomputing, PSB is organized into a series of tracks, minitracks andworkshops.  The <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/junkets/sessions.html#tracks">tracks</a> identify the focusresearch topics for the meeting; <ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/junkets/sessions.html#minitracks">minitracks</a> are opportunities forpresentation of work in emerging research areas; and <ahref="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/junkets/sessions.html#workshops">workshops</a> provide forums fordiscussions of significant infrastructure and other issues.  In addition,PSB offers two invited <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/junkets/sessions.html#keynote">keynote talks</a>, ageneral paper track, poster and demonstration sessions, and plenty ofopportunity for informal public discussion.  Below is a brief list ofsession titles; a more <a href="https://archive.gyford.com/1995/11/13/HotWiredDemo/junkets/sessions.html">detailed description of thesessions</a> is available: <p><ul><li>Internet Tools for Computational Biology<li>Biocomputing Education: Challenges and Opportunities<li>Interactive Molecular Visualization <li>Stochastic Models, Formal Systems and Algorithmic Discovery for Genome    Informatics <li>The Evolution of Biomolecular Structures and the Structure of    Biomolecular Evolution<li>Discovering, Learning, Analyzing and Predicting Protein Structure  <li>Population Modelling <li>Models of Control Systems in Biology<li>Hybrid Quantum and Classical Mechanical Methods for Studying Biopolymers in Solution<li>Computational Studies on the Design of Protease Inhibitors</ul> <H2> Submissions </H2>Full papers, abstracts and demostration proposals are welcome.

Attendessshould book through <strong> United Airlines </strong>using the <strong> meeting  code 560YD </strong>.The discount of 5% to 10% off the best published fares isgood for travel between December 27, 1995 and January 12, 1996.   Unitedflies directly to the Kailua-Kona airport on the Big Island.  However, ifyou desireinter-island flights, we recommend trying the new discount carrier <strong>Mahalo Airlines</strong>, at (808) 833-5555.<p>Avis and Alamo rental car companies will offer, to theattendees of PSB-1, discounts of 10% off the applicable rental rates whenreservations are made in conjunction with United Airlines air reservations.If flying other than United Airlines:Alamo (1-800-328-8018) will offer a 10% discount on retail dailyand weekly rates. Please request Group I.D. number 372255 and Rate Code 9G.Hertz (1-800-654-2240) will offer weekly rates of $149.99 fora compact 2-door car and $159.99 weekly rate for a compact 4-door car.Reference meeting #21094 when making your reservation.<h2> Conference Administration </h2>The conference co-chairs are<p>Dr. Teri Klein<br><address><A HREF="https://archive.gyford.com/cgl/index.html">Computer Graphics Laboratory</A><br>University of California, San Francisco<br>San Francisco, CA 94143-0446 USA<br>phone: +1 (415) 476-0663<br>fax: +1 (415) 502-1755<br>email: <a href="mailto:klein@cgl.ucsf.edu">klein@cgl.ucsf.edu</a></address><p>and<p>Dr. Lawrence Hunter<br><address><A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine</A><br>Bldg. 38A, MS-54<br>8600 Rockville Pike<br>Bethesda, MD 20894 USA<br>phone: +1 (301) 496-9300<br>fax: +1 (301) 496-0673<br>email: <a href="mailto:hunter@nlm.nih.gov">hunter@nlm.nih.gov</a></address><p>For registration and site information, contact the PSB conferencecoordinator:<p>Sharon Surles<br><address><a href="http://www.intsim.com/~isigen">Interactive Simulations, Inc.</a><br>5330 Carroll Canyon Road, Suite 203<br>San Diego, CA 92121 USA<br>Phone: +1 (619) 658-9782<br>fax:  +1 (619) 658-9463<br>email: <A HREF="mailto:psb@intsim.com">psb@intsim.com</A></address><HR>Last modified: June 19, 1995<ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:hunter@nlm.nih.gov"> Larry Hunter, hunter@nlm.nih.gov</A></ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
