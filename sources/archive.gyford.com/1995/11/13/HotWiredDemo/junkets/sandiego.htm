Well, as <ahref="sc95.htm">Supercomputing '95</a> and <ahref="vrml95.htm">VRML 95</a> attendees willdiscover, this Southern California city is a multifaceted urban canvaswith an evergrowing Latino culture, a waning US military presence, anda wave-riding community as perpetual as the tides. They'll alsodiscover San Diego's civic treasure - its idyllic Mediterraneanclimate.<p>On a clear day from the <ahref="cacabri.htm">CabrilloNational Monument</a>, at the end of Point Loma, you can see forever:the arching sweep of the bay, the sandy coastline stretching intoMexico, and, on the horizon, the barrios of Tijuana. Of course, youcan also see nuclear submarines floating like crocodiles in the navalharbor below. <p>This city is really a collection of neighborhoods and sleepycoastal communities. Check out the <ahref="surf.htm">surfing</a>culture described in Tom Wolfe's <cite>The Pump House Gang</cite>thriving on the shores of La Jolla. Low-tech thrill seekers can stillride The Giant Dipper, a restored wooden roller coaster on the MissionBeach boardwalk (this whirligig was built in 1925, the same yearSeymour Cray was born).<p>Wander along the serene Sunset Cliffs, a sandy ribbon on the westside of Point Loma. Go at dusk, and as the luminescent orb slips overthe Pacifichorizon, discuss the existence of the green flash phenomenon. Continuethe debate over gin and tonics at Pacific Shores, a funky bardecorated with Formica seashells and marine motifs. Black lights makethis a glowing experience.<p>In keeping with local tradition, watch the tortilla makers as youwait in line for a chicken burrito at <ahref="gaslamp.htm">ElIndio Shop</a>, a takeout taqueria that has been here on India Streetsince the <i>calle</i> was part of Mexico. But don't burn yourtastebuds - there are dozens of delicioso dishes to be tried in thiscity. Munch on tapas or tap your toes to the live flamenco music atthe festive <ahref="gaslamp.htm">CafeSevilla</a>, located downtown. The nearby Cervecer&#237;a Santa Feserves the most authentic Baja-style whole fried fish north of theborder. And as for raw fish, the defection of the chef from MisterSushi, in Pacific Beach, to Sushi Ota has caused a ricey rift amongmaki lovers. Both eateries are superb.<p>For a peaceful picnic, pick up a layered tofu supreme at thescrumptious Kung Food Deli and walk down El Prado into BalboaPark</a>. This tranquil commons offers walking trails, shadyeucalyptus groves, and 13 museums, housed in old Spanish-Moorishbuildings dating back to the Panama/California Exposition of 1915.<p>Theaters and entertainment venues abound throughout the city, and <ahref="zoom.htm">Zoom san diego</a> is yourcomprehensive guide. Check for the up-and-coming local acid jazz group, TheGreyboy All Stars. Or, if you're tuckered out from the techie talk, slide deepinto a crimson leather booth at The Red Fox Room and let the timeless mood ofthis piano bar relax you. The locals might be right when they say "There's nolife east of I-5."<p>By <a href="mailto:jessie@wired.com">Jessie Scanlon</a><p><h5><i>Sunny thanks to natives Julianna Goodman and Amy Johns,Texas transplant J.
