I work withhigh tech companies trying to help them devise effectivemarketing strategies. At the moment, I am working with a companythat is developing a tool that *COULD* be positioned as an end-userprogramming tool. </P><P>I almost want to tell them to run away from this designation. If I thinkback it seems that despite numerous attempts these tools have never been succesful in the marketplace. Examples that come to mind:</P><P>* Frontier </P><P>* Novel Appware (formerly Serius Developer)</P><P>* ProdeaSynnergy</P><P> It seems that the only instances in which these tools have succeeded is when they are part of larger products or OS (Lotus macro language, MS Visual for Applications, Applescript)</P><p>Why is this? Is there a place for these tools on the market? Is end-user programing just too challenging and difficulta prospect for Joe End-user no matter how elegantthe interface? IS there anything that could have been donedifferently to make these products a success. </P><P>Dave - if you are listening I would appreciate yourinsights with respect to Frontier. I was in the audienceat MacWorld when you demo'ed a final Beta for Frontier. I thought that it was the best thing since sliced bread, butit never found its place in the market. WHY? </P><P>Looking forward to your answers. </P>David Sokolic<A href="index.htm">dsokolic@netvision.net.il</A><h6><a href="index.htm">I N D E X</a> - <a>T O P I C S</a></h6><LI><B>Apple scripting</B><BR><b>Joe Buck (joebuck)</b> on Sun, 29 Oct 95 17:48 PST<BR>Posts <b>4</b> - Last Post: Wed, 1 Nov 95 17:21 PST<p><p>Dave says us Unix weenies would be totally bowledover if we just knew how powerful Apple scriptingis.

In the early 80's, the "computer lab" at my grammar school was stocked with new Apples and I have continued to use Apple and Macs through high school, college, and beyond.  Despite working on a Pentium PC with Windows '95 at work, I can safely say I would never give up my MAC.  Or would I?  For me, life has sort of come full circle since those grammar school days.  I currently work at a software firm across the street from the Apple world headquarters in Cupertino, and I also own stock in the company.  Unfortunately, now as I drive by the big Apple campus on the Infinite Loop on my way home from work, I often find myself muttering and cursing out in the general direction of one of the big corner offices on the top floor. 	I am frustrated because no one from Apple seems to be able to come out and convince me that Apple has a true vision or game plan for long-term success.  Their problem is unique:  A fantastic product, pent-up demand, and a market share that erodes faster than a D.A.'s case in L.A. County.  At this point, I am considering selling my stock and even more shockingly, for me, I find myself looking at PCs (gasp!!) as I prepare to buy a new computer.  I still believe Apple has the superior machine but I have reached the point where if you asked me where Apple would be in two or three years (much less six months) a range of potential answers would come to mind (merged with IBM?, bought by Microsoft?, bankrupt?, back near 10% home market share and facing the same long-term issues etc..).  I depend heavily on technology and my computer, and I now find myself asking whether or not my new MAC will be obsolete (from an industry view) in a couple of years.  While I do expect Apple to be around in 1998, we have recently learned that "reasonable doubt" is a powerful force. 	When can I expect somone at Apple to give me some very compelling reasons as to why I should hold on to my shares and buy another MAC?  Simply being a MAC loyalist is not enough anymore.  It is this fierce loyalty that has kept Apple afloat for the last several years but in a highly competitive capitalistic system, reality almost always triumphs over loyalty.  It's sad, but true.  Occurrences at the recent board meeting also make me worry.  With the apparent survival of Spindler and the "resignation" of the CFO, the clear, orchestrated message was that Apple is going to hunker-down, circle-the-wagons, and fight the long war.  I welcome that enthusiasm and steadfastness but is anyone under the impression that there is a game-plan to win this war?  I welcome reassurances/visions/answers from all including any Apple exec. who would like to take a crack at reassuring a disheartened Apple "fanatic". </PRE><h6><a href="index.htm">I N D E X</a> - <a>T O P I C S</a></h6><LI><B>Response to the BeBox?</B><BR><b>Christian Nyboe (jalmar)</b> on Fri, 6 Oct 95 08:12 PST<BR>Posts <b>6</b> - Last Post: Sun, 22 Oct 95 19:46 PST<p><P>What's your reaction to <a href="index.htm">Jean-Louis Gassée's</a> <a href="http://www.be.com> Be Computers?</A><h6><a href="index.htm">I N D E X</a> - <a>T O P I C S</a></h6><LI><B>The Mozilla that Ate Microsoft ...</B><BR><b>Charlie Stross (charless)</b> on Thu, 21 Sep 95 07:34 PST<BR>Posts <b>7</b> - Last Post: Fri, 27 Oct 95 15:33 PST<p>While Chairman Bill was bolting together a release of Windows that incorporates a web browserthat can't even handle HTML tables, those whacky<A href="index.htm">Netscape</A>dudes just made an end-run around the operatingsystems behemoth.<P>They just announced four new products, includingwhat looks to me like the ultimate killer middlewareapp -- <A href="index.htm">Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0</A>.<P>This little toy <i>edits</i> HTML, supports a loadof interesting kit such as <i>frames</i> (which soundto me like you can use them, finally, to create a transclusivenetwork a la Ted Nelson), <i>Java</i> language support,and ability to play Macromedia presentations.<P>MiddleWare: it ain't just a buzz-word any more.<P>Who cares whether the app you're developing runs on Windows, Linux, or MacOS?

Developers learn an OS to write cool applications for a particular system.  OS programmers write a particular OS to support a hardware system.  Hardware developerscreate hardware to do a particular low-level thing well.<P>Who drives the market?  The people.  Not the developers, not theOS programmers, and not hardware! The people decide what to buy based on how well it suites their needs and interests.<P>Back when not a whole lot of people had computers, applicationslike Photoshop, Word, etc. were the staples of the Maccommunity, because most of the *people* who owned Macs weregraphic designers, artists, musicians, etc... creative people withjust enough nerd quotient to get a computer, and not enoughto put up with a command line.<P>Most people who owned PCs were in business or worked in one, soword processing, database, etc... were the big applications.  Hence,DOS was big.<P>Windows and OS/2 to a lesser extent, filled a kind of crossover gapmade up of people who still needed to use big-business applications,but wanted the "minimum nerd" graphical interface.  Mac did notsatisfy this need because of its relatively 'late' entrance into the business market.<P><BR>Now, big question... with millions of new customers going out and buying computers, what will the demographics look like?  Not nearlyas exciting as they were in the high-business, high-academe ratiosof the past... no, these will be the average consumer, whose interestsare balancing checkbooks, a little wordprocessing, maybe bringingsome work home from the office, and (for the kids...) **games**.<P>You might ask why such a little thing like 'games' should have a huge impact?  Because nearly any machine/OS combo today can doall the other categories well, but only DOS-like machines can do thegame medium *well*.<P>Given the comparable pricing and features, my choice as a consumerwould be the best overall platform, and this would lead me towardsDOS, simply because the most outstanding games are written for it.<P><BR>How could this happen?<P>An action game is the most complex real-time programming code thatcan be written.  Its demands are nothing less that entire control of theplatform.  Platform advances will never outstrip this requirement, because game programmers will continue to want the entire machinefor even more spectacular innovations in code.<P>Gee, Unix programmers have been programming real-time systems fora long time... if it can't be done, how are they doing it?  Two words:external I/O.  I can't load the system with high-priority real-timenon-pre-emptable processes and expect to handle high bandwidthload conditions (like, say, a *multimedia* intensive process!).<P>Even DOS game developers have turned to this technique by usingDMA (Direct Memory Access) hardware.<P><br>Now maybe the announcements regarding Microsoft's future supportfor MPEG hardware and 3D make more sense.  They're politely ignoring all the developers who say that the "consumer" will neverbuy such hardware.<P>What about Macintosh, Amiga, Windows, and .... Windows 95action games, you say!??  Nearly all of them shut-down or block the entire OS while they run and exclusively access thesystems hardware resources.<P>Amiga is too small to worry about.  Mac doesn't die as peacefullyas DOS, plus none of the hardware is documented "officially".Windows is built on DOS, so ***surprise***... amazingly it doesn't have too much trouble chucking itself to the wind to make roomfor a game.  Windows 95 may have more of a problem, supportingmultitasking and protect mode architectures, but watch for a quick bank shuffle (save state, warm boot DOS, quit, restore state)of the entire OS to make room for a full DOS machine. <P><br>Macintosh has not provided this "direct" capability, nor do very manyreal-time game developers know how to access the hardware directlythe way they know DOS.<P><br>So surprise!  If Microsoft is the only platform that supports this kind of access, which platform will the average consumers buy?<P><br>Wake up guys!<P><h6><a href="index.htm">I N D E X</a> - <a>T O P I C S</a></h6><LI><B>Now that Win95 is out...</B><BR><b><a href="index.htm">enice</a>)</b> on Fri, 25 Aug 95 12:52 PST<BR>Posts <b>6</b> - Last Post: Wed, 30 Aug 95 04:56 PST<p><P>Yesterday (August 24), Windows '95 was formally releasedto the planet.
