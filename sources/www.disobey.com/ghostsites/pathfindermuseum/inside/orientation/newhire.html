After a hire has been made, managers must go through the following steps to ensure that the new employee
has all necessary equipment, etc.,  when he or she arrives at TINM.   Allowing a two-week lead time to get
this accomplished is realistic:

<ol type="1" start="1">
	<LI>Contact <a href="mailto:strosser@pathfinder.com">Ed Strosser</a> to go over the following:

<ul type=disc>
	<LI>Name of new employee
	<LI>Exact start date at TINM
	<LI>Seating space  
	<LI><A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/admin/purchase.html#furniture">Furniture</A>
	<LI><A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/orientation/csetups.html">Computer Setups</A> (Specify PC or Mac)
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.timeinc.com">Telephones</A>
</ul><BR>
	<LI>Managers must arrange access, contact list, and alias subscriptions by filling out the following requests:
	
<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/tech/ops/accountrequest.html" >Access / Permissions / Account Requests / SecureID</A>
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/subscribe.html">Subscribe to TINM Contact List and TINM Inside</A>   
		<LI><A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/tech/aliases.html">Subscribe to mail aliases and listservs</A>   
		<LI>Access requests for Ultron-6 and T_PUB_Newmedia (IT managed servers); e-mail: <a href="mailto:Rob_Heller@time-inc.com">Rob Heller</a>
</UL>

 <BR>

<li>The new hire must go to Time Inc. orientation (Monday mornings, 9 a.m. in room 40 A/B).  At orientation they 
will get a security card, which they can bring to the 6th floor and get a valid Time Inc. pass.<BR><BR>


<li>TIME INC. SECURITY CARDS: 
 
<ul type=disc>
	<LI>Regular security cards are given only to full TINM staffers. Temporary employees and green reqs should 
	use daily/weekly/monthly passes given out by the reception desk in the lobby. Managers must call x1633 to 
	reserve a pass for the person.  If the temporary employee or consultant is going to be here for more than three 
	months, a Service Pass may be issued.  The Business Office has to approve a request for a Service Pass, 
	and forward the request to Ron Huff (x1385) in the Security Office  (room 664) with an expiration date. 
     
	<LI>Send requests for service passes to <a href="mailto:admin-request@pathfinder.com">admin-request@pathfinder.com</a> with a full explanation of the 
	employee's job and how long you expect them to be working in the Time & Life Building. 
</ul>
<BR>
<li>STATIONERY: 

<ul type=disc>
	<LI>TINM staffers can order business cards and memo pads only. 
	<LI>Ask your <A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/admin/staff.html#dam">Departmental Administrative Assistant</A> for order forms:  DO NOT USE A XEROX COPY OF THE ORDER 
	FORM -- THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL ORDER NUMBERS ON THEM!
	<LI>Always use generic Time Inc. New Media letterhead.
	<LI>No rush charges (except for salespeople)!
