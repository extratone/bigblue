	Welcome to Time Inc. New Media's intranet, TINM Inside.  Since we launched the intranet in January, we have been making a lot of changes and improvements to the site -- the biggest and best being that we have added in a search function on the TINM Contact List.  Now you can simply type in a person's last name or a department name and you will get a full listing -- including a link to the person's email.  We think this function is pretty cool, and we hope that it will make your life easier and help TINM Inside become a permanant part of your desktop.  <br><P>

	 



In the coming months we will continue to improve TINM Inside, but we need your feedback to help us with this process.  Please continue to send us your thoughts and suggestions.  <BR><P>



For those of you who are coming to TINM Inside for the first time, the setup of TINM Inside is very simple.  You will not have to dig very deep to find what you are looking for.  On the framed navigation bar on the left you will find channels for various subjects:
