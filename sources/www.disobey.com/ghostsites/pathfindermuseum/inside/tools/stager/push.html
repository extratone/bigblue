<h2>Staging files from the UNIX command line. (using the 'push' program)</h2>
<hr>
To use the 'push' program to stage files, you will have to log into
one of the UNIX machines (usually cp.pathfinder.com) using telnet.
<p>
To 'Stage a file' means to test a file and copy it from development 
(the cp.pathfinder.com machine) into production (the web servers).<BR>
Generally you receive an email confirmation for your stage.
<p>
To 'Stage delete a file' means to remove the file from production only
(no files on cp.pathfinder.com will be affected).
<p>
<h2> Some Useful Examples </h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Action Description</th><th>Command to enter at UNIX prompt</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Stage a file (in my current directory)<br>
</td><td>
<code>push index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage a file (in the 'help' subdirectory of my current directory)<BR>
</td><td>
<code>push help/index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage a file (giving full path to the file including the content root '/www')<br>
</td><td>
<code>push /www/help/index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Same as above but no need to specify the content root (/www)<br>
</td><td>
<code>push -U /help/index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage <em>delete</em> a file (in my current directory)<br>
</td><td>
<code>push -R index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage <em>delete</em> a file, ignoring errors which may be reported<br>
</td><td>
<code>push -i -R index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage a file and view the output from the stager<br>
</td><td>
<code>push -s index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage multiple files which match a file specification; here, all html files
in the current directory. (You should first test which files will be matched 
with the command 'ls *.html')<br>
</td><td>
<code>push *.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Stage a file and send email only if errors occur.<br>
</td><td>
<code>push -O SENDEMAIL=ERROR index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Using multiple options at once (delete from production, view output, 
send mail only if an error occurs, and content root not specified)
</td><td>
<code>push -R -s -O SENDEMAIL=ERROR -U /help/index.html</code><br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
To display push options (type push alone)<br>
</td><td>
<code>push</code><br>
</td></tr>

<h2> Push Usage/Options </h2>
<pre>
usage: push opts [--] files ...
       push opts -f filelist-file
       push opts -l push-state-file

where opts is one or more of:

  -Ddebugopt   - Debug-options
  -L logfile   - Logfile where to log debug-output to

  -z target    - What target we should stage to
  -h host      - Host to which we should connect (Stager)
  -p port      - The port to connect to on the staging host
  -O stageopt  - Staging options (see below)
  -s           - Keep the connection and output staging result
  -U           - File(s) specified is relative to content-root
  -i           - [root] Ignore phase 1 errors
  -m           - Stage from the production-master to the servers
  -{r|R}       - Enable removal of files.  Put a '+', or a '-' character
                 in front of each filename to indicate if you want to add (+)
                 or delete (-) the particular file.  If there is no '+' or '-'
                 character, the default is to either add the file (-r), or
                 delete it (-R).

  --           - Indicates the end of options (so a filenames can't be
                 parsed as option in case they start with a dash).

Batch mode options:
  -e           - Only send back an email if the staging fails
  -F emailaddr - [root] email-address to send back reply to
  -S service   - [root] Kerberos service to use
  -u username  - [root] Stage as this user

  where stageopt is one of the following:

    STRICT=[PHASE1|PHASE2] - Set strictness level
    MOUSEOVER
    EXT_TARGET
    SENDEMAIL=[ALWAYS|ERROR|NEVER]
