<BR>The most exciting news to report this month is that the current scandal
surrounding the White House has brought more users to Pathfinder than ever
before.  Every traffic record has been shattered:  During the week of January
19-25, Pathfinder recorded 22.75 million pageviews.  The <B>"Scandal in the
White House"</B> supersite built by the Time Online & Daily teams is truly
exceptional -- and also reached new heights in traffic for Time.com. On Thursday,
January 22, <B>Time Daily</B> recorded 211,000 pageviews --  the highest
single-day pageview figure in Time Daily history. More remarkable, the traffic is
nearly 180 percent higher than what we scored during the height of the
Diana tragedy. <BR>



<BR>In other record-breaking news, Pathfinder now has more than 200,000 registered
users.  According to <B>Jason Lane</B>, Time Inc. New Media began offering user
registration in October 1996;  by September 1997 we hit the 100,000 mark -- so in
less than four months we have doubled the number of registered users.  The entire
<B>TINM commerce team</B> deserves credit for this great achievement.
