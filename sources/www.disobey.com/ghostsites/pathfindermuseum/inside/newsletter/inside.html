<BR>The <B>Marketing Services</B> team has created several new databases that
will greatly improve the way the sales folks can do business.  They have put
together four databases:  competition, sponsorships, presentations and account
database, which the sales team can use on all calls.  These databases are a
milestone work for the ad sales and marketing departments.  Contact <a href="mailto:gmonaco@pathfinder.com">Gina Monaco</a>
for more information.<BR>



<BR>The <B>Commerce team</B> continues to bring in new revenue every week: the SI
catalog did $14,000 in Internet sales the first week of Jan, $19,000 the second
week, and $30,000 this past week (Super Bowl)!<BR>



<BR>The <B>Brand Development</B> team, along with TINM's online ad agency Darwin
Digital, has created a ground breaking way of driving users to The Pathfinder
Network. A banner ad that can be updated instantly at the hands of an editor will
begin running next week on sites such as Yahoo, Lycos, ZDNet and Pathfinder. This
banner provides the latest news headlines with links back to Pathfinder for the
story. This application gets around the previous obstacles of promoting the
latest story via the search engines and updates the copy of a banner without the
delay times of a media buy.  This is a first for web advertising and it's coming
from Time Inc. New Media!!<BR>



<BR>The <B>The Core Technology</B> team has cleaned out approximately 3 GB
(gigabytes) of content off the Pathfinder servers in only one month!   Amanda's
team continues to work on the cleanup of the production web servers, and have 1)
provided the titles with broken link listings for their entire site on the
production web servers, 2) made a list of files in production which have no known
mime type 3) created a list of orphaned files (i.e. nothing links to these
files).  A committee has also been formed to gather statistics on overall page
sizes at Pathfinder and the number of connections a browser makes to the
Pathfinder servers for a particular page.   For example, the Pathfinder home page
requires 25 connections to a web server to retrieve all its assets.<BR>
