<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR="#FF000">Flora Garcia and her team are hosting weekly
learning sessions on Wednesdays at 3 pm in the 5th floor large  conference room. 
The sessions are geared toward the editorial staff, but everyone is  invited.<BR>

<BR><B>Feb. 4: Amanda Hanes, "Managing a Mailing List</B>."  Mailing lists are a
way to add interactivity to a site.  Hundreds of thousands of people are
subscribed to TINM mailing lists, yet many people administering them know only a
few of the commands.  Amanda will discuss the existing mailing

lists, bulk deleting users, bulk adding users, searching your list for

users who want to be taken off, and other things that will make handling a

list easier.  This is primarily for those people who manage lists, but also

for anyone who would like to learn how to incorporate them into a site.<BR>



<BR><B>Feb. 11:  Josh Hochman, "Browsers and Content</B>."  Netcaster and Active
Desktop are getting a lot of attention lately.  Putting flat HTML pages into
dynamic formats makes no sense, but what does make sense?  What

elements work and what doesn't? How should we think about these interfaces?

Josh will demo the good, the bad and the ugly and get folks thinking about

dynamic content.  This is for everyone.<BR>



<BR><B>Feb. 18:  Tom Snee, "Unix" (con't)</B>.  This will be the continuation of
the Unix for Beginners class from last month.  Tom will talk *briefly* about vi
and Emacs, then about the find command and grep.  Tom is going to assume you
attended the first Unix session and can telnet in to CP, move around your content
and list the contents of directories.  This session is primarily for webmasters
and folks managing sites.<BR>



<BR><B>Feb. 25:  Eugene Lee, "Web Fundamentals</B>."  This will be a basic
discussion of the technology of the web.  Eugene will explain what a browser is
and how it interacts with a server, how information gets from the Web to your
computer, what a CGI is and what cookies are.  Can you give a conceptual
definition of  TCP/IP?  If not, you really need to come to this class.<BR>



<BR>If you have a topic you would like to see covered or if you would like for
