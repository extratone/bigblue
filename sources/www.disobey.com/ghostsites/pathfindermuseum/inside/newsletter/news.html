<P><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The TIME folks have been busy!  The
scandal supersite at one time or another has involved people from all walks of
Pathfinder life. It was kicked off as a single page by <B>Dick Duncan</B>,
<B>Flora Garcia</B>, <B>Mark Coatney</B> and <B>Meg Siesfeld</B>, with <B>Ronnie
Peters</B>, <B>Paul Notzold</B> and <B>Alex Juarez</B> working on design.  As the
scandal escalated, the site was blown into the "supersite" category.   <B>Josh
Quittner</B> and Dick Duncan oversaw the development of the supersite;  <B>Mac
McKean</B> was the senior producer on the project;   <B>Mo Barrett</B> (who
created much of the content) and <B>Larry Hewitt</B> were producers. <B> Mark
Coatney</B> added to the "Law & History" area of the site daily, and also served
as lead news editor. <B>Christina Tzouras</B> contributed design revisions; 
<B>Sean Stafford</B> and <B>Tim Ungs</B> were the production gods;  <B>Melissa
Ciano</B> was responsible for all the photos;  <B>Jonathan Gregg</B> copy-edited
and did some blurb and headline writing.  There were many writers that
contributed -- most stories were done by <B>Chris Taylor</B>, <B>Frank
Pellegrini</B> and Mark Coatney, with contributions from <B>Michael Goldfarb</B>
and Mac McKean.<BR>



<BR>The TIME Supersite also drew large crowds on Yahoo during the week.  On
Tuesday, 1/27, during the President's State of the Union address, TIME Executive
Editor John Stacks fielded questions from 1,200 people who sent up 996 questions.
That crowd was twice as large as the all-time record-holder on Pathfinder!  On
Wednesday, 1/28, Judge Lawrence Walsh, who served as independent counsel for
Iran-Contra, received more than 500 questions from the audience. TIME Community
Producer <B>Paul Hechinger</B> managed the events with the help of TIME Online
writer <B>Elizabeth Owen</B> and his assistant, <B>Janice Castro</B>.  </P>

At last, real-time stock quotes on the Net - FREE!  Through a special arrangement
with Thomson Financial Services, Money.com is offering its users free access to
up to 50 real-time quotes a day.  Along with up-to-the-minute stock price
information, users get a detailed company tipsheet containing intraday and
12-month graphs, analysts estimates, insider trading trends and more.<BR>



<BR>The other big news at Money is that they're rolling out rev. 1 of their
mutual fund finder, which was developed in conjunction with Thomson Financial. 
It offers users a way to screen Thomson/CDA's 7500-fund database on dozens of
factors ranging from performance, to risk, to types of stocks held, to expenses. 
The folks at Money expect this will be one of the most thorough fund screeners on
the Net, but what will really set it apart is that it was designed by Money's
chief fund writer Jason Zweig, and features his explanations and advice every
step of the way.
