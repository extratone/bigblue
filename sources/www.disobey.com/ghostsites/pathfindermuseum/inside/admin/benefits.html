<H3>IT'S ABOUT TIME</H3>

<P>
The policies and practices described below should be viewed as
general guidelines. They are not set in stone, and they are not intended
to be (nor do they represent) a contract of employment, and do not confer
legal rights. They are subject to change by Time Inc. management at any
time, with or without notice at the Company's sole discretion. Employment
at Time Inc. is &quot;at will&quot; which means that you or the Company
may end your employment or change the terms of your employment at any time
without notice. 
<BR>

<BR>
Although your manager and division head are ultimately responsible for applying
HR policies and practices on a day-to-day basis, you should feel free to
contact Human Resources at any time with questions or problems concerning
the items covered in &quot;It's About Time,&quot; or to discuss any aspect
of your employment here. <BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><H2>WELCOME TO TIME INC.</H2><BR>
One of the most remarkable qualities of Time Inc. is the stimulating atmosphere
found in all Time Inc. locations across the country, and indeed around the
world. This environment is created by the people who work here. <BR>
<BR>
People here share an eagerness to perform at the very highest levels, to
create new and better ways of getting things done, and to exchange ideas
and information. This excitement is contagious. It doesn't seem to wear
off, even after you've been working at Time Inc. a long time.<BR>
<BR>
Another thing you'll notice is a strong sense of individualism and independence.
You won't find any &quot;rule books&quot; here, no rigid list of &quot;do's&quot;
and &quot;don'ts.&quot; We share a common respect for the integrity and
judgment each person brings to the job.<BR>
<BR>
As you may have already guessed, we expect you to bring a questioning attitude.
A hearty and wholesome irreverence is welcome here.<BR>
<BR>
Time Inc. is constantly changing. We need people to expect change and roll
with it. Whatever has been done in the past can be done still better in
the future. That striving makes us strong. It makes us who we are as an
organization.<BR>
<BR>
Our human resources policies and practices reflect this environment. You
won't find an iron-clad set of rules that everyone follows in exactly the
same way. Our objective is to temper consistency with flexibility to address
human resources matters intelligently and fairly within the context of business
needs.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>WHO TO TURN TO</H2>
The primary responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of human resources
policy rests with division and department heads as well as individual managers.
They:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>Set and maintain job performance standards.
    <LI>Provide direction, guidance and evaluation needed
    <BR>
    to meet and exceed these standards.
    <LI>Work with staff members to get the job done even
    <BR>
    better.
    <LI>Respond to staff objectives, concerns and problems.
    <LI>Comply with all applicable legal requirements
    in the workplace.
  </UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
The Human Resources Division has special responsibilities. Human Resources
staff provide advice and counsel to both managers and employees in all aspects
of the Company's human resource policies and practices.<BR>
<BR>
Talk to anyone in Human Resources at any time if you can't find an answer
to a question, if you feel that a policy has not been properly applied in
your situation, or if you believe the answer you're getting is just plain
wrong. Human Resources is there to try to resolve the problem.</P>

<A NAME="Employment at Time Inc."></A><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><BR>
<H2>EMPLOYMENT AT TIME INC.</H2>
There are four types of employment status at
Time Inc. Each is based on the period of time and nature of work for which
an individual's services are needed. Each employment status has its own
distinctive requirements and benefit eligibility. All four categories may
be filled with either full-time or part-time staff. Full-time employees
are scheduled to work at least 35 hours every week, sometimes in fewer than
five days. Part-time employees are hired for a specific number of hours
a week (but fewer than 35.) Part-timers may work at two jobs in the Company.
<BR>
<BR>
Depending on the nature of the job, an employee may or may not be eligible
for overtime pay for hours worked beyond a normal full-time work schedule.
Employees in jobs that are not eligible for overtime pay are referred to
as exempt (i.e., exempt from laws and Company rules requiring overtime pay),
and those in jobs that are eligible for overtime pay are referred to as
non-exempt.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>The four types of employment are:<BR>
<BR>
</I>Regular employees</B> are hired into roles for which there is a continuing
need. If you are a regular employee hired before May 25, 1995, you are eligible
for all Company benefits whether you are full-time or part-time, including
medical and tuition reimbursement benefits. If you are a regular employee hired
on or after May 25, 1995, you are eligible for all Company benefits other
than medical and tuition reimbursement benefits whether you are full-time
or part-time, and you are eligible for medical and tuition reimbursement
benefits as well if you work an average of at least 17.5 hours per week. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Project employees</B> are hired to work on special projects, generally
a minimum of six months, with a predictable end date. A project can last
more than a year. Project employees usually are not transferred from one
project to another. If a new job assignment is made, creating a service
period of more than a year, the project employee's status generally will
be changed to regular employment. Project employees are eligible for the
same benefits as regular employees, except Parental and Discretionary leaves.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplementary employees</B> are hired for periods of more than six months
and up to a year to replace employees temporarily away, or to staff-up during
peak work loads. Supplementary employees are eligible for the same benefits
as regular employees, except Parental and Discretionary leaves.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Temporary employees</B> are hired for short-term needs of generally less
than six consecutive months. Temporary employees are not eligible for paid holidays,
leaves of absence, or any other benefits, except that temporary employees
meeting minimum eligibility requirements may participate in the Time Warner
Employees' Pension Plan and the Time Warner Employees' Savings Plan.<BR>
<BR>
Other individuals are needed from time to time to perform services for the
Company, such as independent contractors (including freelancers and stringers)
or agency-provided temporary help. Agency-provided temps generally include
secretaries and other clerical, administrative, and pro-fessional support
who are hired by the hour or day or other short assignment. Agency-provided
temps are not Time Inc. employees and are not eligible for Time Inc. benefits.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Independent contractors</B> (including freelancers and stringers) are
specialists contracted on an individual basis. They are not Time Inc. employees
and are not eligible for benefits. These individuals exercise control over
their own work and time, generally perform their work away from Time Inc.
offices, and are generally paid according to the terms of the job rather
than the amount of time spent on it.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>PROBATIONARY PERIOD</H3>
All new regular employees are hired on a trial, or probationary, basis.
Typically the probation period is three months for a non-exempt employee
and six months for an exempt employee, although this may vary from division
to division. This period allows both you and the Company to review the &quot;fit&quot;
between you and the position you've been hired for. If you are unable to
meet performance standards or expectations during the probation period,
you may be dismissed without notice and severance pay. In some cases, the
probation period may be extended. If so, you should generally be notified
in writing. <BR>
<BR>
Once you have completed the probationary period, your employment remains
&quot;at will,&quot; which means that either you or the company can end
your employment at any time, with or without notice. </P>

<A NAME="workhours"></A>

<P><BR>
<H3>WORK HOURS AND SCHEDULES </H3>
The demands of our business require that work schedules be flexible. Work
schedules vary from department to department. Smooth functioning requires
a clear understanding of work-hour requirements based on the job, the department
and the schedules of colleagues. <BR>
<BR>
The work week for a full-time employee is typically at least 35 hours, Monday
through Friday. The usual work day is seven hours, plus one unpaid hour
for lunch. Some employees work 35 hours or more in three or four days. For
others, working Saturday or Sunday is normal. Meal schedules and starting
and quitting times also vary. In some areas, a written schedule of start
times, meal hours and quitting times may be posted.<BR>
<BR>
Department heads try to plan work schedules far enough ahead so that you
may plan your time accordingly. But since unexpected events have no respect
for established routine, you may be required to work overtime unexpectedly.
If overtime is routine, your manager will let you know.<BR>
<A NAME="lateness"></A><BR>
<H3>LATENESS AND ABSENCE</H3>
In Time Inc.'s professional work environment, you're expected to avoid lateness
or unexpected absence. If you are going to be late or absent, call your
manager as soon as possible so that appropriate coverage, if any is needed,
can be arranged. <BR>
<BR>
Occasional lateness and absence are generally not reasons for docking pay
or reducing overtime for other days in the week. However, if you are a non-exempt
employee, your manager can dock your pay or ask you to make up the time
if you're late or absent too often. If you are required to work overtime
to make up for the time off, you will be paid at the appropriate overtime
rate. If unplanned and unexcused lateness or absenteeism continues to be
a problem and impacts your performance, a warning notice or other disciplinary
measure may be warranted, up to and including termination of employment.<BR>
</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><BR>
<A NAME="Expectations for Our Work Environment"></A><H2>EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT</H2>
Time Inc. expects all business relationships
to be handled with honesty and integrity. You are expected to show professional
judgment and respect for others at all times. In particular, Time Inc. strictly
prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on race, color, sex, age,
religion, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, disability,
or other protected characteristics. Everyone who works for the Company has
the right to expect to perform his or her job free of any kind of bias.<BR>
<BR>
Harassment is a specific type of discrimination. Sexual, racial, ethnic
or other improper harassment in any form verbal, physical or visual is illegal
and strictly against Company policy, and may result in disciplinary action
up to and including termination of employment.<BR>
<BR>
Staff members are encouraged to report any incidents of sexual harassment
or unwelcome sexual advances, whether by innuendo, physical contact, verbal
suggestiveness of a sexual nature, or even via E-Mail communications. Harassing
or other discriminatory comments or behavior based on race, color, sex,
age, religion, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, disability,
or other protected characteristics are equally unacceptable. You should
feel free to raise complaints about any type of harassment to your manager,
another management representative, your department head, your Division's
Human Resources Director or other Human Resources representative, and/or
one of the Company's Equal Employment Officers. Of course, complaints must
be made in good faith.<BR>
<BR>
Human Resources is responsible for thoroughly investigating complaints of
this nature, and taking prompt action as appropriate to respond to instances
of harassment and prevent future harassing conduct. In handling harassment
complaints, Human Resources will maintain confidentiality to the extent
possible within the context of the Company's obligation to prevent harassment
on the job. <BR>
<BR>
You may not be retaliated against for raising good-faith concerns about
sexual or other types of harassment. In fact, retaliation against employees
raising these types of concerns is itself a clear violation of Time Inc.
policy, and may result in disciplinary action up to and including the termination
of employment of any individual(s) responsible for such retaliation.<BR>
<BR>
A complete statement of Time Inc.'s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment
policies appears in the Time Inc. human resources policy manual, and reminders
about these policies are circulated periodically to management and staff.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<H2>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION </H2>
Time Inc. has a strong commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity and an
Affirmative Action Program to ensure that this commitment is met. Human
Resources is available for consultation with department heads and staff
members on any subject related to equal opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
Equal employment opportunity is not only an important social concern, it
is also an important business objective. To have all segments of the population
reflected in our work force will help provide the diversity and creativity
needed to solve the challenges facing our business today and in the future.<BR>
<BR>
In selecting staff, we use the yardsticks of skills, knowledge, ability,
intelligence, originality, and other job-related qualifications. All applicants
for employment and all employees are hired and promoted without regard to
race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, sexual
orientation, disability, status as a veteran of the Vietnam Era, or other
protected characteristics. All human resource practices are administered
in accordance with applicable equal employment and fair employment practices
laws.<BR>
<BR>
In accordance with federal and applicable state and local laws, the Company
invites all employees and applicants for employment to self-identify as
a qualified individual with a disability, for purposes of allowing the Company
to provide a reasonable accomodation, where possible, to enable him/her
to perform the essential functions of the job. <BR><BR>
<A NAME="smoking"></A>
<BR><H2>SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE WORK PLACE</H2>

  <BR>
  <B>Smoking Cessation Programs </B>
  <DT>Time Inc.'s Medical Department provides a variety
  of smoking cessation strategies and programs to assist employees requesting
  assistance. For further information, contact the Medical Department at
  212-522-2576. If you have questions about any aspect of this policy, please
  contact Administrative Services at 212-522-1449 or your Human Resources
  Director.<BR>
  <BR>
  Time Inc. offices outside New York City also comply with any applicable
  laws regulating smoking in the workplace.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B><A NAME="alcohol and drugs">  Alcohol and Drug Abuse </B><BR>
  Drug and alcohol abuse are medical problems with identifiable symptoms
  and treatments. Seeking treatment for a drug or alcohol dependency will
  not jeopardize job security or future employment opportunities. Whether
  you seek help from the Medical Department on your own or are referred by
  a manager, your confidentiality and privacy is maintained in the same way
  it would be with any other illness.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Company does have a legitimate concern and responsibility when alcohol
  consumption or drug use affects job performance. If performance is affected
  by drug or alcohol use, it should be managed consistent with any other
  performance problem situation, in consultation with Human Resources.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Drugs and Alcohol on Company Premises </B><BR>
  The use, sale, or possession of any controlled substance on Company premises
  is strictly forbidden. Likewise, use of alcohol or drugs on the job is
  prohibited, except for reasonable consumption of alcohol at Company-sponsored
  events. Human Resources should be advised immediately if a problem situation
  arises relating to drug or alcohol use. Violation of the Company's drug
  and alcohol policy is defined as gross misconduct and may result in immediate
  dismissal without notice or severance pay.<BR>
  <B><BR>
  Safety</B><BR>
  In General While Time Inc. is responsible for providing a safe working
  environment for all staff, you need to take an active part in promoting
  workplace safety as well. Make sure your equipment and work area are maintained
  properly. Report any unsafe working conditions to your manager so that
  potential hazards or injury can be corrected or avoided. If you are injured
  on the job, you should be referred to the Medical Department immediately
  for evaluation, treatment, and documentation of the injury. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Work Space </B>
  <DT>Many employees at Time Inc. use computers extensively
  to perform their jobs. It's important that you use them safely to avoid
  injury. Time Inc. will reimburse up to $75 for an    eye exam for employees
  who work with computers to the extent not already covered by your medical
  insurance. Call the Medical Department for further information, including
  advice on creating an ergonomically sound work station.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B><A NAME="Violence in the Workplace">  Violence or Threats in the Workplace</B> 
  <DT>As a fundamental part of workplace safety, the
  Company strictly forbids violence in the workplace or otherwise directed
  at Company employees or other individuals with whom we do business. This
  includes acts of violence toward people or property, as well as threats
  of violence or intimidation that make others feel that their personal security
  is at risk. Obviously, no weapons of any kind are allowed in the workplace
  at any time. Violation of this policy is defined as gross misconduct and
  may result in immediate dismissal without notice or severance pay. Security
  and Human Resources should be advised immediately if potentially violent
  or threatening situations arise, so that appropriate steps can be taken
  to ensure the safety of all.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Confidentiality</B><BR>
  Under no circumstance can you profit financially or assist another to profit
  from using confidential or privileged information you obtain concerning
  Time Inc. or other companies that is not known to the general public. More
  broadly, we expect you to treat all information you obtain in connection
  with your work at Time Inc. as Company-confidential. The Company's policy
  on Securities Transactions, which describes the general confidentiality
  obligation of all Time Inc. employees, appears in the Time Inc. human resources
  policy manual, available from your manager or Human Resources.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Conflicts of Interest </B><BR>
  In general, the Company allows freelance work, provided there is no conflict
  of interest and it does not interfere with your job performance here. Examples
  of a conflict of interest are freelance work for a direct competitor or
  using Company material, information, or property for outside work. Clear
  all outside work, including outside magazine, book, video or film projects,
  with your manager before you accept it to avoid a conflict of interest.
  This is particularly important if you need to obtain required rights of
  approval.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Other examples of a possible conflict of interest include (but are not
  limited to):</B>
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>When you or an immediate family member holds
  a significant interest in a competitor's, supplier's or customer's business.
  <LI>When you or an immediate family member accepts
  gifts of a substantial value, loans or services, entertainment or travel
  from a person or company that might benefit from a connection with Time
  Inc. or where such a gift might give the appearance of impropriety.
  <LI>If you are publicly identified with a major state
  or national political candidate, or use Company supplies or facilities
  for political activity, whether or not on business hours.
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>All of these activities should be avoided. If
  you think you may have a potential conflict of interest, discuss it with
  your department head, as violations of the Company's Conflict of Interest
  policy may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination
  of employment. The Company's complete policy on Conflicts of Interest is
  available from your manager or Human Resources.<BR>
  <BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>
 <A NAME="Pay Practices"></A><DT><BR>

<B>Pay Practices</B><BR>
  Time Inc. is a &quot;pay-for-performance&quot; company. That means that
  while jobs of similar responsibility have similar earning potential, we
  also distinguish among levels of performance in administering our compensation
  programs.  The explanation provided here describes the general approach to compensation
  at Time Inc., but you should note that specific practices may vary from
  division to division.<BR>
  Department heads determine what we refer to as job worth, or the rate of
  pay for each position. Job worth is based on both internal and external
  considerations for example, experience, skills and performance of individuals
  in the position and the external job market for similar jobs. The people
  primarily responsible for judging your rate of pay and your performance
  are your manager or department head, along with Human Resources. <BR>
  <BR>
  A raise which you earn because of your performance is a merit increase.
  Merit increases are recommended by managers who have first-hand knowledge
  of your work. How much of an increase you receive depends not only on your
  performance but also on the merit budget guidelines established by the
  Company for a given year. <BR>
  <BR>
  The Company generally reviews salaries once a year (or, for highly paid
  positions, every 15-18 months) to determine eligibility for merit increases.
  Whether you will receive an increase (and the amount of any increase) will
  depend on your performance, job worth, and how much you earn relative to
  others in similar jobs. The timing of your salary review may also be affected
  by whether you have been on leave or sabbatical, by your hire date, and/or
  by the timing of your division's salary review process. <BR>
  <BR>
  A raise which you earn when a job has changed or your responsibilities
  have significantly increased is a promotion increase. You may receive a
  promotion when you transfer from one department to another with greater
  job responsibilities, or when you assume additional responsibilities within
  the same department. Promotional increases generally occur at the time
  of your promotion. The amount of a promotion increase may take into account
  whether you are eligible for bonus pay of some kind, whether or not you
  are moving from a non-exempt to an exempt job, and the pay level of other
  staff in the same job you're being promoted to. <BR>
  There are special circumstances when a salary adjustment is made that is
  neither a merit nor a promotion increase for example, a transfer into a
  job with reduced requirements or responsibility, or a substantial gap between
  current pay for the job versus the outside marketplace. In cases like this,
  which could involve a salary decrease, your manager or Human Resources
  should discuss the adjustment with you. <BR>
  <BR>
  How increases are communicated varies by department. Typically, either
  your manager or department head will tell you before you receive a salary
  increase in your check and explain how the increase percentage was determined.
  This may follow a discussion about your performance. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Incentives and Rewards</B> <BR>
  The Company offers bonus plans which provide an opportunity for eligible
  employees who meet certain performance or financial targets. Compensation
  for these participants is viewed on a &quot;total cash&quot; basis that
  is, both base salary and the bonus incentive are considered elements of
  their pay. Your manager or department head will let you know if you are
  eligible to participate in an incentive plan. <BR>
  <BR>
  Spot bonuses are special awards that may be granted, at the Company's discretion,
  for completion of a project or task that is beyond the scope of your regular
  job. A spot bonus is not the same as a salary increase it is a one-time
  payment. The amount of any spot bonus is determined at the discretion of
  your manager or department head, to recognize performance &quot;above and
  beyond&quot; the call of duty. <BR>
  <A NAME="overtime"></A><BR>
   <B>Overtime</B> <BR>
  Your manager is responsible for planning work schedules in a way that minimizes
  unnecessary or excessive overtime. All overtime must be authorized in advance
  by your manager. The number of hours worked and the number of hours scheduled
  must be reported weekly on time cards and sent to the Payroll Department
  in order for overtime to be paid. <BR>
  <BR>
  The federal Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable state laws outline
  the legal requirements concerning jobs which are by their nature and content
  eligible for overtime. Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime.
  If you are exempt , you are not eligible for overtime. Exempt jobs are
  generally those in executive, managerial, professional or sales job categories.
  The Company's overtime practices are only applicable to you if you are
  a non-exempt employee. <BR>
  <BR>
  Non-exempt employees (whether full- or part-time) at Time Inc. are eligible
  for overtime pay at time-and-a-half the regular rate of pay for hours worked
  beyond the regular full-time work schedule in the division (at least 35
  hours per week). <BR>
  <BR>
  Detailed overtime rules may apply in circumstances where you work on a
  Company holiday, on a scheduled day off, outside the office, in another
  department, or on an &quot;on call&quot; basis. Your manager or Business
  Office should be able to answer any questions you may have about overtime.
  In addition, more details about overtime practices appear in the Time Inc.
  human resources policy manual. <BR>
  <A NAME="directdeposit"></A><BR>
  <B>Your Bi-Weekly Check and the Direct Deposit Option</B>
   <BR>
  Payday is every other Thursday. For most staff members, the salary check
  covers the current week and the week before the one in which payment is
  made.<BR>
  <BR>
  Direct deposit of your paycheck into your checking or savings account is
  available for you to access the funds through your bank account on payday.
  Use of direct deposit is enthusiastically encouraged as the safest, fastest,
  and most convenient way to receive your paycheck. If you elect to use this
  service, obtain a direct deposit authorization form from the Payroll Department.
  <DT><BR>


  <B>Salary Deductions</B> <BR>
  Every salary check is subject to certain deductions, all of which are listed
  separately on your paycheck stub. Some deductions are required by law for
  example, withholding for federal, state and city income taxes, and for
  Social Security (FICA). If you have any questions about these withholdings
  or would like to have more or less than the normal amount deducted, call
  the Payroll Department or send an E-Mail to PAYROLL_HELP.<BR>
  <BR>
  Other deductions may relate to your contributions to participate in Time
  Inc./Time Warner benefit plans or the portion of your salary you have authorized
  to be deducted toward the Time Warner Employees' Savings Plan or to your
  Flexible Spending Account for health or dependent care (see Benefits at
  Time Inc., page 18).<BR>
  <BR>
  You may also authorize deductions from your paycheck for certain personal
  expenditures such as United States Savings Bonds or United Way of Tri-State
  contributions. Authorized deductions may also include union dues if you
  are in a job covered by Time Inc.'s agreement with the Newspaper Guild
  and you have elected to pay membership dues to the Guild. These deductions
  will appear in a separate listing on your pay stub.

 <A NAME="Time Off From Work"></A>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

  <DT><BR>
 <A NAME="vacation"></A><H2>TIME OFF FROM WORK</H2>

  <DT><B>Vacations</B><BR>
  All Time Inc. employees (other than temporary employees) who have been
  on staff for at least six months are eligible for a vacation with pay.
  The amount of vacation depends on your length of service, which also includes
  periods of prior employ- ment with Time Inc. with breaks in service of
  less than one year.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you are a non-exempt employee, you are eligible for three weeks of vacation
  per year during the first five full years of employment, four weeks per
  year during the sixth through fifteenth years of employment, and five weeks
  per year thereafter. If you are an exempt employee, you are eligible for
  four weeks per year through the fifteenth year of employment, and five
  weeks per year thereafter.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you work part-time, you are eligible for the same number of weeks specified
  above, but pro-rated based on your average weekly hours worked during the
  prior year.<BR>
  <BR>
  During your first year with Time Inc., the amount of vacation you are eligible
  for is pro-rated. Schedules for pro-rating vacations are available from
  your Business Office or Human Resources, and are also included in the Time
  Inc. human resources policy manual.<BR>
  <BR>


<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>


  The time you schedule your vacation is decided by you and your manager
  or department head. Subject to business needs, you may generally take 
  two weeks of vacation consecutively. Vacation time should be taken
  every year and generally may not be carried over for the following year.
  Pay is not granted in lieu of vacation time.<BR>
  <BR>
<B> Holidays and Personal Days</B><BR>
  Time Inc. provides non-temporary staff ten paid holidays a year plus two
  personal days off.<BR>
  <BR>
  In the Fall of each year, the ten scheduled holidays for the following
  year are announced to staff. The Company tries to provide long weekends
  whenever possible and at the same time recognize different closing schedules
  of our publications. <BR>
  <BR>
  If a holiday falls on your day off, you are eligible for another day off
  in its place. If you must work on a holiday and are a non-exempt employee,
  you will be compensated at time-and-a-half, in addition to your regular
  holiday pay for that day. If you are an exempt employee, you will generally
  be given a compensatory day off if you are required to work on a holiday.<BR>
  <BR>
  You may schedule two personal days at the mutual convenience of you and
  your department head. These days must be taken during the calendar year.
  They may not be carried forward from one year to the next. If you began
  work on July 1 or later, you will be eligible for one personal day to be
  used in the balance of the year.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you work part-time, holidays are pro-rated based on the average weekly
  hours worked during the prior year. Non-exempt part-timers who are required
  to work on holidays are paid at overtime rates.<BR>
  <B><BR>
   Other Time Off</B><BR>
  Personal days or vacation days should be used in order to observe a religious
  holiday or day of personal conscience. If the work schedule does not allow
  for accommodation, you or your manager should consult Human Resources.<BR>
  <BR>
  Routine medical and dental appointments should be arranged so as not to
  conflict with work hours. If this is impossible, time off may be granted
  with supervisory approval. If a full day is needed, it should be taken
  as a vacation day or personal day.<BR>
  <BR>
  You are entitled to reasonable time off to vote in accordance with local
  laws. In New York State, if there are fewer than four consecutive hours
  between the time the polls open and the time you must report to work (or,
  between the time of leaving work and the time the polls close), you may
  take up to two hours off to vote. If you expect to need the time, you should
  let your manager know in advance that you will need the time off. If you
  are outside New York State, check with your manager or Human Resources
  for local voting leave requirements.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you receive a notice for jury duty, you should inform your manager or
  department head immediately. Time off with full pay will be granted if
  you are required to serve on a jury during your regularly scheduled work
  days and are not a temporary employee. Part-timers are paid based on the
  average hours worked. If you are released from jury duty at a reasonably
  early hour, you are expected to report to work.<BR>
 <A NAME="leaves"></A> <BR>
 <B>Leaves of Absence</B><BR>
  Time Inc. employees who meet eligibility requirements may be eligible for
  time off for Short-Term Disability Leave (also referred to as Sick Leave),
  Parental Leave, Family and Medical Leave, Military Leave and Emergency
  Leave. Conditional and unconditional unpaid leaves are also granted at
  management's discretion. All questions related to leaves should be directed
  to your manager or Human Resources.<BR>
  <B><BR>
  Short-Term Disability Leave (Sick Leave)</B> <BR>
  An illness- or disability-related absence of more than seven days is covered
  by Time Inc.'s Short-Term Disability (STD) Leave Policy. Eligible employees
  may qualify for STD leave at full or partial pay on the recommendation
  of the employee's physician and approval by the Company.<BR>
  <BR>
  You or your manager must notify the Medical Department or the Company's
  STD insurance carrier when you expect to be out for more than seven days
  or if you are hospitalized for any length of time, so that you can apply
  for STD benefits. Information about diagnosis and treatment is of course
  handled confidentially. When you return from STD leave, you are required
  to obtain medical approval before returning to work. More details about
  the Company's STD Leave policy are available from Human Resources or the
  Medical Department.<BR>
  <B><BR>
  Paid Maternity Disability Leave</B><BR>
  Female employees who are physically unable to work because of pregnancy
  and/or childbirth are eligible to receive Short-Term Disability benefits
  during the disability period. Maternity-related disability is subject to
  the same limits as other disabilities under the Company's STD Leave policy,
  and must be approved by the Company. If you work part-time, your pay is
  computed on the basis of your regularly scheduled hours. <BR>
  <B><BR>
	Parental Leave</B><BR>
  Up to six months of parental leave may be granted following the birth
  or adoption of a child. This leave enables parents the opportunity to care
  for their new child and arrange for child care. Both men and women who
  have been working for Time Inc. at least six months before starting the
  leave are eligible for parental leave. <BR>
  <BR>
  One week of parental leave is paid. Paid leave must be taken within six
  months of the birth or adoption. For childbearers, this paid week would
  normally be added to any portion of paid disability leave. The remainder
  of the parental leave is unpaid. <BR>
  <BR>
  At the beginning of a parental leave, you will receive prorated vacation
  pay for any time due. Additional vacation days are prorated from the date
  of your return from the leave to the end of the calendar year.<BR>
  <BR>
  Parental leave must be arranged in advance with your department head. You
  should discuss the anticipated departure date and the length of the leave
  you expect to take so that coverage can be arranged. You will need to advise
  the Medical Department (in cases of pregnancy) and your Business Office
  when planning a leave. For further details, including guidelines about
  returning to work and information about company benefits during parental
  leave, contact Human Resources or the Medical Department.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Leaves Under the Federal Family and <BR>
  Medical Leave Act of 1993 </B><BR>
  <BR>
  The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (&quot;FMLA&quot;) provides up
  to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year to eligible employees for the birth
  or adoption (and subsequent care) of a child, for the employee's own serious
  health condition, or for the employee to care for a child, spouse or parent
  with a serious health condition. <BR>
  <BR>
  In most cases, Time Inc.'s Parental Leave and/or Short-Term Disability
  Leave policies provide benefits far more generous than what staff are entitled
  to under the FMLA. In many cases, employees may be eligible for leave under
  both FMLA and Company policy, in which case the leaves run concurrently.
  However, in circumstances where other Company-provided leaves would not
  otherwise meet the requirements of the FMLA (primarily, cases involving
  a staffer's need for leave to care for a child, spouse or parent with a
  serious health condition), you will be eligible for FMLA leave as appropriate.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Company will ask you to provide certification of any leave that qualifies
  under the FMLA, and will notify you of any leave that has been approved
  for FMLA coverage. Complete details about your eligibility, rights and
  benefits under the FMLA are available from the Medical Department or Human
  Resources, and are also provided in the Time Inc. human resources policy
  manual.<BR>
  <BR>
  
</DL>

<H2><BR>
Other Leaves</H2>

<DL>
  <DT><B>Emergency Leave </B>
  <DT>In the unfortunate event of death, critical illness
  or other serious emergencies in your immediate family, your department
  head may grant an emergency leave with pay for a period of up to one week.
  An extension must be referred to Human Resources. When granted, it is typically
  unpaid or taken as vacation time. &quot;Immediate family&quot; is usually
  defined as your or your spouse's (or domestic partner's) immediate family,
  including children, parents, siblings, grandparents or a live-in relative.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Military Leave </B>
  <DT>If you are a Reservist in any branch of the Armed
  Forces, or a member of the National Guard, you will be granted time off
  for military training (normally 14 days plus travel time) in addition to
  your vacation. Please advise your department head of your training schedule
  as far ahead as possible. Military leaves are granted with full salary
  when you submit an authorized statement signed by your commanding officer.<BR>
  <B><BR>
  Discretionary Leaves </B>
  <DT>Conditional and unconditional leaves of absence
  without pay are granted at management's discretion. Human Resources must
  be notified of all requests for a discretionary leave.
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>An unconditional discretionary leave entitles
  you to return to the same job or a comparable one. If your old job has
  been discontinued and a comparable job is not available, you will be terminated
  due to a job elimination, with eligibility for appropriate notice and severance.
  <LI>A conditional discretionary leave does not guarantee
  you a job on return from leave. If your old job is no longer available
  and a suitable job cannot be found, you will be terminated as a result
  of a resignation, which does not warrant notice or severance.
</UL>

<DL>
  <A NAME="Performance and Career Development"></A><B><BR>
  
<B> <H2>Performance and Development</H2></B> <BR>
</B>
  <DT><B>Training and Development </B><BR>
  Improving one's knowledge and skills is essential for everyone in the workforce
  today. The rapid pace of change and introduction of new technologies and
  work processes means you have to work hard just to stay current, let alone
  ready for the future. <BR>
  <BR>
  Work with your manager or department head to get the training you need
  to do your job well. Sometimes, it can be as simple as getting the right
  coaching or advice when you need it. &quot;On-the-job training,&quot; which
  can come from your manager or other staff members, is often the most valuable.
  <BR>
  <BR>
  More formal kinds of training, including seminars or college courses and
  other resources, can also be helpful. Your department head and Human Resources
  can help steer you in the right direction. They can also let you know how
  Time Inc.'s Tuition Reimbursement Program applies to you.<BR>
  <BR>
  The commitment to learning starts with you. Look for ways you can build
  it into your job every day, not as a one-time event or &quot;magic bullet.&quot;<BR>
  <A NAME="review"><BR>
  <STRONG>Performance Feedback and Annual Reviews</STRONG><BR>
  There are generally at least four things you need to know in order to get
  your job done:
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>How your job is defined.
  <LI>What your manager or department head expects
  for the job to be done well.
  <LI>How your work compares with that expectation.
  <LI>What you need to keep on doing, do differently,
  or stop doing.
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT>When you and your manager talk about these four
  things and/or other items related to your performance, you are getting
  performance feedback. Regular communication helps you identify both successes
  and problems. It also gives you an opportunity to ask for help and decreases
  the likelihood of unpleasant surprises during a formal performance evaluation.<BR>
  <BR>
  Your manager is generally responsible for ensuring that you know what is
  expected of you and for providing you with performance feedback as appropriate.
  But it is a responsibility you share. Ask for information from your manager
  to help you be clear about your performance goals, how well they are being
  achieved, and what you can do to do even better. <BR>
  <B><BR>
  Performance Planning and Review (PPR)</B><BR>
  Each division generally has its own program for planning and reviewing
  performance, which is commonly referred to as Performance Planning and
  Review, or PPR. Each division has an approach to PPR that reflects its
  own management and work style. As such, you will find that the timing and
  frequency of a PPR discussion will vary, as will the format used to capture
  goals or summarize discussions. Typically, you and your manager should
  have a &quot;formal&quot; PPR discussion at least annually. You may have
  a separate conversation that addresses the impact of your performance on
  salary. But whatever your division's approach, managers should generally
  provide their staff with a complete review of performance at least once
  a year. If for any reason you're not getting an annual review, ask for
  it.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Elements of the PPR you most likely will find are:</B>
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>Goal Setting. You and your manager should assess
  your accomplishments in meeting the job's priorities, your demonstrated
  strengths, and your development areas, to reach a common understanding
  about what is expected of you in the coming review period. 
  <LI>Performance Evaluation. You and your manager
  should discuss the results achieved toward both established goals and unplanned
  events, your demonstrated strengths and needs for development or improvement,
  as well as priorities for the coming period. 
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>To get the most out of any performance discussion,
  prepare for the meeting. Have specific points you can make and questions
  to ask. Seek input and feedback, then listen. Check for understanding and
  emphasis to make sure you're in sync. And follow through on commitments
  you make when you get back to the job.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Promotions</B><BR>
  <BR>
  When it comes to promotions, there is one common denominator: promotion
  to a new job depends on doing a good job in the one you have and demonstrating
  the potential to succeed in a job with more responsibility. Promotions
  are not rewards for years of service. <BR>
  <BR>
  Hard work and a &quot;track record&quot; of accomplishments are both factors
  that can lead to promotion. Other frequently overlooked but important factors
  are how you demonstrate flexibility, adaptability, commitment to learning,
  and receptivity to new ideas and ways of working. Look for ways to show
  these skills in your current job so that you can point to them as examples
  of what you can do in another assignment.<BR>
  <B><BR>



<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
  Job Growth Within the Department</B><BR>
  The most logical job growth for many people is within their own department.
  Your department head and others around you can help you attain new skills
  and duties, adding new dimensions and worth to your job. You may be able
  to reach out for additional duties and responsibilities as you sense what
  is needed and what you can do. While this may not add worth to the job,
  it may provide a unique opportunity for you to enhance your skills in your
  current job.<BR>
  <BR>
  When jobs of greater responsibility become available within your department,
  your knowledge of the operation can help give you an advantage. Your department
  head will assess the skills needed for the job. He or she may determine
  that the job will be redefined, or seek to fill the job in a different
  way than it may have been filled in the past. Let your department head
  know of your interest in other jobs, both in your department and in other
  areas of the company. From time to time, Human Resources will ask your
  department head to suggest candidates to fill openings elsewhere.
  <DT><B><BR>

  Transfers</B><BR>
  Anyone in Human Resources is available to talk to you about your career
  interests, your job, or one you may aspire to. Human Resources can advise
  you on how to prepare yourself for other jobs and offer a realistic assessment
  of the chances of moving to other types of work.<BR>
  <BR>
  Knowing your interests and aspirations, Human Resources is better equipped
  to refer you to openings that occur in other parts of the Company. You
  may request that career discussions with Human Resources be kept confidential.
  However, you should advise your department head before interviewing with
  another department. In general, you are expected to remain in your current
  job for at least a year before seeking a transfer elsewhere within the
  Company.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Job Postings</B><BR>
  When positions become available, qualified internal candidates are considered
  whenever reasonably practicable. Each Monday a list of current job openings
  in New York (JOB LIST) is posted on on-line bulletin boards accessible
  through CC:Mail. It is also available in hard copy in the reception area
  of Human Resources in the Time &amp; Life Building in New York. <BR>
  <BR>
  Jobs are generally posted for at least two weeks before any candidate is
  hired, although both internal and external candidates may be interviewed
  at any time. Typically, positions outside of New York City are not posted
  on JOB LIST, but may be posted locally. Staff members interested in any
  open job are urged to get more information and apply.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Employee Referrals</B><BR>
  If you refer an outside candidate to a position posted on JOB LIST who
  is hired and successfully completes the probationary period, you will receive
  $1500 (less withholdings). Contact Human Resources when you make the referral
  to be sure it is properly recorded and tracked.<BR>
  <BR>
  In referring candidates, keep in mind that it is against Company policy
  to have two employees who are related to one another in a supervisory relationship.
  This includes a parent, grandparent, child, spouse, sibling or domestic
  partner.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Performance Management and Warning Process</B>
  <BR>
  As part of the Performance Planning and Review (PPR) process, you and your
  manager generally will have reviewed your performance goals, what is expected
  of you in performing your job, and how well you are doing in achieving
  these goals and expectations. <BR>
  <BR>
  In situations where you have completed the probationary period, yet you
  are not meeting your performance goals or your manager's expectations for
  the job, you may receive a warning. The purpose of this warning process
  is for your manager to help you understand the seriousness of the situation,
  what the performance problems are, and his or her expectations for improvement.
  Specific, two-way com-munication is key for you to get back on track. <BR>
  <BR>
  Typically, when the warning process is followed, it may involve several
  distinct steps. These steps are merely guidelines for managing performance,
  and do not provide a guarantee that an employee will receive a warning
  or go through a particular step in the warning process. Any and all of
  these steps may be accelerated or bypassed at the Company's discretion
  when circumstances warrant: 
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Concern Conversations. </B>When
  a performance problem arises, the manager explains what the problem is
  and what needs to be done to maintain performance at an acceptable level.
  
  <LI><B>Oral Warning. </B>If,
  after at least one conversation in which the manager discusses the performance
  problem and its remedies, performance has not improved, the employee should
  be warned that his or her job may be in jeopardy unless performance standards
  are met.
  <LI><B>Final (Written) Warning.</B>If performance still has not reached acceptable performance
  standards after the warning, the employee is provided with a written perfor-
  mance warning and given a final chance to correct the situation within
  a specified time frame.
  <LI><B>Termination.</B>
  When performance has failed to improve on a sustained and satisfactory
  basis, termination of employment may be warranted. See Dismissal for Poor
  Performance below. 
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT><BR>
  Performance warning steps are not appropriate for temporary, project or
  supplementary employees.<BR>
  <BR>
  The length of a warning or final warning may vary according to the type
  and severity of the problem, the complexity of the job and the employee's
  work history and length of service. If you participate in a warning discussion,
  you may request a written description of the problems, the specific performance
  changes asked for, and the time frame in which you are asked to accomplish
  them.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you have recently been issued a warning for poor performance, you should
  generally not expect a merit increase.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>

  <A NAME="Other Important Policies"></A><A NAME="resignations"></A><B>
 <B>OTHER IMPORTANT POLICIES</B> <BR>
<BR>
  </B><B>Resignations</B> <BR>
  If you decide to leave the Company, you should give your department head
  at least two weeks' advance notice.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Dismissal and Poor Performance</B> 
  <BR>
  Dismissal for poor performance is a last resort for persistent performance
  problems. In general, for non-supervisory employees, the Company attempts
  to provide oral and written warnings, in consultation with Human Resources,
  before a dismissal for poor performance. There are some exceptions to this
  approach, including but not limited to:<BR>
  
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>Employees with significant managerial or supervisory
  responsibility. 
  <LI>Employees with access to confidential or systems
  information. 
  <LI>Employees guilty of gross misconduct (such as,
  but not limited to, theft, sale of drugs or use of drugs or alcohol on
  the premises, violence in the workplace, destruction of machinery or other
  equipment, gross dereliction of duties, violation of the Company's Conflict
  of Interest policy, purposeful deterioration of performance, or harassing
  or discriminatory conduct).
  <LI>Employees whose continued employment during the
  warning process could be detrimental to the functioning of the operation
  as determined by management. 
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT><BR>
   <B>Notice and Severance Pay For Poor Perfomance Based
  Terminations</B><BR>
  Employees who are dismissed for poor performance with or without warning
  or who resign while on final warning may be eligible for notice and severance
  pay, according to the company's notice and severance policy, with the exception
  of employees terminated for gross misconduct. They are not eligible to
  receive notice or severance.<BR>
  Part-time staff terminated for performance reasons are eligible for notice
  and severance in accordance with the same policy as full-time employees,
  but based on average weekly pay during the past year. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Job Elimination</B><BR>
  Job eliminations can occur for a number of reasons, including but not limited
  to any of the following situations:
</DL>

<UL>
  <LI>A division, department or function is eliminated.
  
  <LI>Job functions are merged and fewer people are
  needed.
  <LI>A job function changes so markedly that the person
  doing it is no longer sufficiently qualified.
  <LI>The total number of people in a department is
  reduced. 
</UL>

<DL>
  <DT>Determinations about job eliminations are generally
  made at the divisional level. Typically, criteria such as job function,
  skills, ability and performance are the factors considered in selecting
  employees for job elimination. Seniority is usually not a factor.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Help With a Job Search</B><BR>
  Human Resources is available to help displaced employees find another job
  within the Company. If your job is eliminated, you may interview for any
  open position within Time Inc. for which you are qualified.<BR>
  <BR>
  If your job is eliminated, you are generally guaranteed another job or
  a comparable one in the same division if such a job becomes available within
  a specified period of time after the elimination and you did not opt to
  resign or take notice and severance in a lump sum. If more than one job
  was eliminated, the hiring manager has the prerogative to decide which,
  if any, of the several job eliminated employees should be offered the job.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you are terminated due to a job elimination, upon request Human Resources
  will send you the weekly list of Company job openings for a year following
  your last day on the payroll.<BR>
  <BR>
  If you are rehired more than a year after the last day on the job, your
  prior length of service is not counted in determining eligibility for policies
  where length of service is a factor, other than for calculating vacation.
  If you are rehired anywhere within the Time Warner family, you forfeit
  any remaining severance payments (or, if you elected a lump sum payout
  of severance, you will be required to return the unused pro-vata share
  of severance before beginning your new job).<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Retraining</B><BR>
  If your job is eliminated, you will be eligible for retraining reimbursement
  up to a maximum of 15% of your notice and severance up to $5,000 to help you learn
  new skills in order to qualify for your next job. Check with your manager
  or Human Resources on what expenses are covered under this program. Employees
  who receive Executive Outplacement are not eligible. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Mutual Trials</B><BR>
  If your job is eliminated and you accept a significantly different job
  elsewhere in the Company, you will generally be considered to be on a mutual
  trial for the first three months. During this time, you may choose to resign
  and still collect notice and severance pay. Or, your new manager may terminate
  you without notice and you will be eligible for notice and severance pay
  based on the original job elimination.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Sale of the Company</B><BR>
  For jobs in a division or department that is sold, notice and severance
  are not provided if the individual continues to work for the purchaser,
  unless the dismissal is within a time limit determined at the time of sale.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Notice and Severance for Job Eliminations </B><BR>
  Notice and severance pay is provided to employees terminated due to job
  elimination, according to the Company's notice and severance policy.<BR>
  <BR>
  Part-time staff are eligible for notice and severance pay in accordance
  with the same policy as full-time employees, but based on average weekly
  pay during the past year.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Return of Company Property </B><BR>
  When you resign or are terminated, your department head or manager will
  request your identification card, security pass card, office keys, corporate
  charge cards and other Company property you may have. In addition, you
  will be required to return any Company computer or other equipment you
  may have in your possession, and your access to Company computer and information
  systems will end.<BR>

  </B>A number of generous and competitive benefit
  programs are offered to eligible Time Inc. employees. The summaries below
  provide a quick overview of the Company's main benefit plans. But for more
  details or for complete descriptions of the plans, contact Benefits Services.<BR>
  <BR>
  These highlights do not contain details which are found in the various
  plan documents and insurance contracts which set forth the actual terms
  of the relevant benefit plans. The specific language of these plans prevails
  in the event of any inconsistency between their terms and the brief summary
  provided here. Time Inc., Time Warner Inc. and the designated benefits
  administrative committee(s) reserve the right to change, amend or terminate
  a plan at any time for any reason, and to interpret the terms of the plans
  in their sole discretion. <BR>
  <BR>
 <B>Medical and Dental Plans</B><BR>
  Participation in the Time Warner Group Health Plan protects you against
  much of the costs of an illness or injury, and provides coverage for preventive
  health care, mental health/substance abuse and prescription drugs. Dental
  coverage is offered through the Time Warner Dental Program. You contribute
  to help pay for these benefits. How much you pay depends on the level of
  insurance coverage you elect, whether or not you use the services of physicians
  in or out of network, and how many people you elect to cover. You may change
  your coverage elections once a year during Time Inc.'s open enrollment
  period in November, or when you have a change in life status, such as marriage
  or a new dependent. More details about these plans can be obtained by calling
  Benefits Services.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Time Warner Employees' Savings Plan</B><BR>
  Eligible employees with more than a year of service may participate in
  the Time Warner Employees' Savings Plan. You may elect to contribute 2%
  to 6% of eligible compensation to your Savings Plan account, up to an annual
  IRS limit. These contributions are deducted from your pay before federal
  (and in most cases, state and local taxes) are withheld, thus reducing
  your current taxable income. For every $3 you contribute, the company contributes
  a $2 match on a pre-tax basis, up to a maximum annual match of $2,000.
  This match vests over time. A number of investment options are available
  to you in the Savings Plan.<BR>
  <BR>
  As a component of the Savings Plan, the Company provides a profit-sharing
  program which is based on annual performance goals. Profit sharing payouts
  up to 8% of earned salary of which 50% is contributed directly to your investment
  account and 50% is paid in cash.<BR>
  <A NAME="fsa"></A><BR>
 <B>Flexible Spending Account</B><BR>
  Flexible Spending Accounts enable you to reduce the impact of health and
  dependent day care costs by allowing you to use before-tax dollars to pay
  for them. You may elect to allocate up to $5,000 of covered expenses in
  either a health care or dependent day care account, or both. The Internal
  Revenue Service Code requires that any unused amounts in your year-end
  account must be forfeited. Changes in your contributions are allowed only
  if you experience a change in life status. That's why it's very important
  that you plan your expenses accurately and understand what expenses are
  eligible for reimbursement.<BR>
  <BR>
 <B>Long Term Disability</B><BR>
  Long Term Disability (LTD) insurance protects your income should you become
  disabled for a period of more than 26 weeks and are unable to work. All
  LTD eligibility determinations are made by Time Inc.'s insurance carrier.
  You may pay for some portion of the premium for LTD insurance, based on
  your pay and the level of coverage you elect.<BR>
  <BR>
 <B>Life Insurance</B><BR>
  The company offers a variety of life insurance coverage options to you,
  including basic life, optional life, accidental death and dismemberment
  and business travel accident benefits.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Tuition and Reimbursement</B><BR>
  You are encouraged to further your education through the Tuition Reimbursement
  Program. If you take a course which your department head approves as being
  related to your current job, you will be reimbursed upon completion for
  100% of the tuition and registration costs.<BR>
  <BR>
For any other course you complete in an accredited degree-granted institution,
the company will reimburse you for 75% of your tuition and registration costs, up
to a maximum of $2,300 per calendar year. 
For <A HREF="https://www.disobey.com/inside/admin/index.html">health club</A> membership fees, reimbursement is
50% up to a maximum of $750 in a calendar year. <BR>
<BR>
  Related costs (for example, for books, supplies or transportation) are
  not reimbursable. You should note that health club reimbursement and some
  education reimbursements are considered &quot;wages&quot; under IRS rules,
  and are treated as taxable income to you. However, these rules are subject
  to change at any time by the IRS. Further information about these programs
  and their tax status can be obtained from Benefits Services.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Employee Assistance Program</B>(EAP)
 <BR>
  The EAP offers Time Inc. employees, their families and their significant
  others a confidential place to go to get quality professional help with
  personal problems like emotional stress, financial difficulties, family
  tensions, personal legal concerns or problems related to drugs or alcohol.
  The EAP also administers dependent care resource and referral services
  to assist with childcare and eldercare issues.<BR>
  <BR>
  The EAP handles &quot;everyday&quot; problems, not just &quot;life and
  death&quot; situations. It's always best to seek help before a problem
  seems too big to handle.<BR>
  <BR>
  Corporate Counseling Associates, an external organization, provides these
  services. They have offices in New York City and affiliates wherever there
  are Time Inc. locations. The EAP phone number is 1-800-833-8707. More information
  about the EAP can be obtained through the Medical Department or Human Resources.
  <DT><BR>
  The EAP service is free to employees, families and significant others.
  Costs for additional services that the EAP may recommend may be covered
  by our medical plan.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Matching Grants Program</B> <BR>
  Time Inc. supports two grant programs Education and Arts &amp; Culture
  by matching employee contributions to eligible organizations within certain
  dollar limits. You need not have attended the institution to which you
  make the contribution. For current information and an application, call
  Corporate Contributions at 212-484-6565, or pick up a Matching Grant Form
  from Human Resources or Benefits Services.<BR>
