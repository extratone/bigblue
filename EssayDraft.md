# Non-Commercial, Open Source, and Federated Social Platforms as Effective Community Alternatives

## Comparing the design philosophies, business ethics[[DB1\]](#_msocom_1) , and aggregative behavior of commercial and non-commercial, federated social media services.

This essay seeks to examine the breadth of donor-funded, open source, federated social networks as *technical* alternatives to commercial online environments like Facebook and Twitter as measured by their users’ overall satisfaction with them as means of social interactivity over time. Following recent debates and confusion regarding the ethics in the practices of the organizations which built them and the extent of their complicity in the radical cultural consequences of digital communication surrounding the United States’ Presidential Election in 2016, it proposes that greater rhetorical and legislative attention be invested in the tangible, documented[[DB2\]](#_msocom_2) [[DB3\]](#_msocom_3) design decisions across their products’ history as the most crucial, relevant, and effective means of understanding the whole context[[DB4\]](#_msocom_4) , within which it will define *open source software development* and *federated networking* in contrast to the guarded industry establishment which the dominant services have transitioned from *disrupting* by design to entirely exemplifying thus far in the century. After examining conspicuous alterations and inexplicably silent feature additions and subtractions across the whole of social network development, as well as their eventual result’s reflections on the conscious satisfaction of individual social media users, it will conclude by profiling a select few communities thriving on donation-funded, collaboratively-maintained, and/or decentralized platforms as superior foundations upon which citizens of the web might rebuild their own traumatized and fragmented networks when they are ready to begin again[[DB5\]](#_msocom_5) .

## Introduction

If we accept Electronic Mail as the absolute genesis of what we call “social media,” the term becomes inextricably linked with the history of the World Wide Web as a whole. (Edosomwan) The technical protocol we know as Email is by nature “decentralized,” “distributed,” *and* “federated” as the terms are used in this essay because it is technically unbeholden to any single transmission or client service – commercial or not – and it allows users to participate with any server installation they choose, up to and including personal email servers installed in one’s home. (Lee) In this essay, “decentralized social networks,” “distributed social platforms,” and “federated social networking” fall together under the category of “open web technologies,” which are by definition non-proprietary. (Open Web Foundation) This essay proceeds under the notable assumption that The Web as a whole “was, at its core and in its design, a democratizing technology,” and that its potential to be more “open” will remain limitless as long as its fundamental structure is at all recognizable as The Web[[DB6\]](#_msocom_6) .

## Comments

 [[DB1\]](#_msoanchor_1)Actually, no - this essay will *not* be handling ethical/ideological/political thinking (beyond a focus on *alt* intellectual property, perhaps.) It is actually worth explicitly expressing this design in the essay, itself, for the sake of framing its simple necessity. From the driest, least-ideological perspective, commercial social media services are *technically* inferior to their decentralized, open source counterparts *if we measure the overall performance of such a service by the satisfaction of its users* rather than the respective business' ability to generate revenue.



 [[DB2\]](#_msoanchor_2)If I were to spend significant time dwelling on *any* legal or otherwise mob actions as means of progress toward understanding, it must be for *understanding*, alone. That is to say, *"justice"* has nothing to do with it.



 [[DB3\]](#_msoanchor_3)Given that Facebook, specifically, has become the most powerful influence on the human intellect in its history as a species and yet also remains one of the least-transparent technology companies in existence in terms of publicly-available documentation, surely the American Justice system would not be taboo in at least *considering* making an exemption of the IP laws that allow them to remain obscured and doing so with the public's ear.

 

If a single company had managed to buy *one third* of *all dry land on Earth*, only to leave it ravaged round-the-clock by tremendous wild fires, would we not feel justified in ignoring the ancient parchment barring us from *searching company land without a warrant* to at least take a look around for what was starting them?



 [[DB4\]](#_msoanchor_4)Another important tool in understanding the context would be to emphasize the parallels between the sort of innovation these companies were doing in their very beginning - as *disruptors* - with the superior innonvation coming now from young, creative developers - as *disruptors* - but in an actually-admirable way instead of an easy-to-make-fun-of one.

 

*You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself (and your hundreds of thousands of employees) out-coded by a single, strange young German man.*



 [[DB5\]](#_msoanchor_5)Obviously, we're going to implicitly suggest that Web 2.0/commercialized social media is far beyond repair and needs to be purged.



 [[DB6\]](#_msoanchor_6)This definitely needs a reword.
